Some short Greek renderings in the main text were printed as page footnotes. To avoid confusion with the links to the scholarly notes,
these have been moved to parentheses next to the English renderings and higlighted thus: commandant <span class="extra" title="moved from footnote">(<span title="archôn" class="grk">&#x1F04;&rho;&chi;&omega;&nu;</span>).</span>

<h3>INTRODUCTION.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">THE SIGNIFICANCE OF FRANZ CUMONT'S WORK.</p>

  <p>Franz Cumont, born January 3, 1868, and educated at Ghent, Bonn,
  Berlin, and Paris, resides in Brussels, and has been Professor in the
  University of Ghent since 1892. His monumental work, <i>Textes et
  monuments figurés relatifs aux mystères de Mithra</i>, published in 1896
  and 1899 in two volumes, was followed in 1902 by the separate
  publication, under the title <i>Les Mystères de Mithra</i>, of the second
  half of Vol. I, the <i>Conclusions</i> in which he interpreted the great
  mass of evidence contained in the remainder of the work. The year
  following, this book appeared in the translation of Thomas J. McCormack
  as <i>The Mysteries of Mithra</i>, published by the Open Court Publishing
  Company. M. Cumont's other work of prime interest to students of the
  ancient faiths, <i>Les religions orientales dans le paganisme romain</i>,
  appeared in 1906, was revised and issued in a second edition in 1909, and
  is now presented in English in the following pages.</p>

  <p>M. Cumont is an ideal contributor to knowledge in his chosen field. As
  an investigator, he combines in one person Teutonic thoroughness and
  Gallic intuition. As a writer, his virtues are no less pronounced.
  Recognition of his mastery of an enormous array of detailed learning
  followed immediately on the publication <!-- Page vi --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="pagevi"></a>[vi]</span>of <i>Textes et
  monuments</i>, and the present series of essays, besides a numerous
  series of articles and monographs, makes manifest the same painstaking
  and thorough scholarship; but he is something more than the mere
  <i>savant</i> who has at command a vast and difficult body of knowledge.
  He is also the literary architect who builds up his material into
  well-ordered and graceful structure.</p>

  <p>Above all, M. Cumont is an interpreter. In <i>The Mysteries of
  Mithra</i> he put into circulation, so to speak, the coin of the ideas he
  had minted in the patient and careful study of <i>Textes et
  Monuments</i>; and in the studies of <i>The Oriental Religions</i> he is
  giving to the wider public the interpretation of the larger and more
  comprehensive body of knowledge of which his acquaintance with the
  religion of Mithra is only a part, and against which as a background it
  stands. What his book <i>The Mysteries of Mithra</i> is to his special
  knowledge of Mithraism, <i>The Oriental Religions</i> is to his knowledge
  of the whole field. He is thus an example of the highest type of
  scholar&mdash;the exhaustive searcher after evidence, and the sympathetic
  interpreter who mediates between his subject and the lay intellectual
  life of his time.</p>

  <p>And yet, admirable as is M. Cumont's presentation in <i>The Mysteries
  of Mithra</i> and <i>The Oriental Religions</i>, nothing is a greater
  mistake than to suppose that his popularizations are facile reading. The
  few specialists in ancient religions may indeed sail smoothly in the
  current of his thought; but the very nature of a subject which ramifies
  so extensively and so intricately into the whole of ancient life,
  concerning itself with practically all the manifestations of ancient <!--
  Page vii --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="pagevii"></a>[vii]</span>civilization&mdash;philosophy, religion,
  astrology, magic, mythology, literature, art, war, commerce,
  government&mdash;will of necessity afford some obstacle to readers
  unfamiliar with the study of religion.</p>

  <p>It is in the hope of lessening somewhat this natural difficulty of
  assimilating M. Cumont's contribution to knowledge, and above all, to
  life, that these brief words of introduction are undertaken. The
  presentation in outline of the main lines of thought which underlie his
  conception of the importance of the Oriental religions in universal
  history may afford the uninitiated reader a background against which the
  author's depiction of the various cults of the Oriental group will be
  more easily and clearly seen.</p>

  <p>M. Cumont's work, then, transports us in imagination to a time when
  Christianity was still&mdash;at least in the eyes of Roman
  pagans&mdash;only one of a numerous array of foreign Eastern religions
  struggling for recognition in the Roman world, and especially in the city
  of Rome. To understand the conditions under which the new faith finally
  triumphed, we should first realize the number of these religions, and the
  apparently chaotic condition of paganism when viewed as a system.</p>

  <p>"Let us suppose," says M. Cumont, "that in modern Europe the faithful
  had deserted the Christian churches to worship Allah or Brahma, to follow
  the precepts of Confucius or Buddha, or to adopt the maxims of the
  Shinto; let us imagine a great confusion of all the races of the world in
  which Arabian mullahs, Chinese scholars, Japanese bonzes, Tibetan lamas
  and Hindu pundits should all be preaching fatalism and <!-- Page viii
  --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="pageviii"></a>[viii]</span>predestination, ancestor-worship and
  devotion to a deified sovereign, pessimism and deliverance through
  annihilation&mdash;a confusion in which all those priests should erect
  temples of exotic architecture in our cities and celebrate their
  disparate rites therein. Such a dream, which the future may perhaps
  realize, would offer a pretty accurate picture of the religious chaos in
  which the ancient world was struggling before the reign of
  Constantine."</p>

  <p>But it is no less necessary to realize, in the second place, that, had
  there not been an essential solidarity of all these different faiths, the
  triumph of Christianity would have been achieved with much less
  difficulty and in much less time. We are not to suppose that religions
  are long-lived and tenacious unless they possess something vital which
  enables them to resist. In his chapter on "The Transformation of Roman
  Paganism," M. Cumont thus accounts for the vitality of the old faiths:
  "The mass of religions at Rome finally became so impregnated by
  neo-Platonism and Orientalism that paganism may be called a single
  religion with a fairly distinct theology, whose doctrines were somewhat
  as follows: adoration of the elements, especially the cosmic bodies; the
  reign of one God, eternal and omnipotent, with messenger attendants;
  spiritual interpretation of the gross rites yet surviving from primitive
  times; assurance of eternal felicity to the faithful; belief that the
  soul was on earth to be proved before its final return to the universal
  spirit, of which it was a spark; the existence of an abysmal abode for
  the evil, against whom the faithful must keep up an unceasing struggle;
  the destruction of the universe, <!-- Page ix --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="pageix"></a>[ix]</span>the death of the wicked, and the eternal
  happiness of the good in a reconstructed world."<a name="NtA_1"
  href="#Nt_1"><sup>[1]</sup></a></p>

  <p>If this formulation of pagan doctrine surprises those who have been
  told that paganism was "a fashion rather than a faith," and are
  accustomed to think of it in terms of Jupiter and Juno, Venus and Mars,
  and the other empty, cold, and formalized deities that have so long
  filled literature and art, it will be because they have failed to take
  into account that between Augustus and Constantine three hundred years
  elapsed, and are unfamiliar with the very natural fact that during all
  that long period the character of paganism was gradually undergoing
  change and growth. "The faith of the friends of Symmachus," M. Cumont
  tells us, "was much farther removed from the religious ideal of Augustus,
  although they would never have admitted it, than that of their opponents
  in the senate."</p>

  <p>To what was due this change in the content of the pagan ideal, so
  great that the phraseology in which the ideal is described puts us in
  mind of Christian doctrine itself? First, answers M. Cumont, to
  neo-Platonism, which attempted the reconciliation of the antiquated
  religions with the advanced moral and intellectual ideas of its own time
  by spiritual interpretation of outgrown cult stories and cult practices.
  A second and more vital cause, however, wrought to bring about the same
  result. This was the invasion of the Oriental religions, and the slow
  working, from the advent of the Great Mother of the Gods in B.&nbsp;C. 204 to
  the downfall of paganism at the end of the fourth <!-- Page x --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="pagex"></a>[x]</span>century of the Christian
  era, of the leaven of Oriental sentiment. The cults of Asia and Egypt
  bridged the gap between the old religions and Christianity, and in such a
  way as to make the triumph of Christianity an evolution, not a
  revolution. The Great Mother and Attis, with self-consecration,
  enthusiasm, and asceticism; Isis and Serapis, with the ideals of
  communion and purification; Baal, the omnipotent dweller in the far-off
  heavens; Jehovah, the jealous God of the Hebrews, omniscient and
  omnipresent; Mithra, deity of the sun, with the Persian dualism of good
  and evil, and with after-death rewards and punishments&mdash;all these,
  and more, flowed successively into the channel of Roman life and mingled
  their waters to form the late Roman paganism which proved so pertinacious
  a foe to the Christian religion. The influence that underlay their
  pretensions was so real that there is some warrant for the view of Renan
  that at one time it was doubtful whether the current as it flowed away
  into the Dark Ages should be Mithraic or Christian.</p>

  <p>The vitalization of the evidence regarding these cults is M. Cumont's
  great contribution. His perseverance in the accurate collection of
  material is equalled only by his power to see the real nature and effect
  of the religions of which he writes. Assuming that no religion can
  succeed merely because of externals, but must stand on some foundation of
  moral excellence, he shows how the pagan faiths were able to hold their
  own, and even to contest the ground with Christianity. These religions,
  he asserts, gave greater satisfaction first, to the senses and passions,
  secondly, to the intelligence, finally, and above all, to the conscience.
  "The spread of the Oriental religions"&mdash;again I quote <!-- Page xi
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="pagexi"></a>[xi]</span>a summary from
  <i>Classical Philology</i>&mdash;"was due to merit. In contrast to the
  cold and formal religions of Rome, the Oriental faiths, with their hoary
  traditions and basis of science and culture, their fine ceremonial, the
  excitement attendant on their mysteries, their deities with hearts of
  compassion, their cultivation of the social bond, their appeal to
  conscience and their promises of purification and reward in a future
  life, were personal rather than civic, and satisfied the individual
  soul.... With such a conception of latter-day paganism, we may more
  easily understand its strength and the bitter rivalry between it and the
  new faith, as well as the facility with which pagan society, once its
  cause was proved hopeless, turned to Christianity." The Oriental
  religions had made straight the way. Christianity triumphed after long
  conflict because its antagonists also were not without weapons from the
  armory of God. Both parties to the struggle had their loins girt about
  with truth, and both wielded the sword of the spirit; but the steel of
  the Christian was the more piercing, the breastplate of his righteousness
  was the stronger, and his feet were better shod with the preparation of
  the gospel of peace.</p>

  <p>Nor did Christianity stop there. It took from its opponents their own
  weapons, and used them; the better elements of paganism were transferred
  to the new religion. "As the religious history of the empire is studied
  more closely," writes M. Cumont, "the triumph of the church will, in our
  opinion, appear more and more as the culmination of a long evolution of
  beliefs. We can understand the Christianity of the fifth century with its
  greatness and weaknesses, its spiritual exaltation and its puerile
  superstitions, if we <!-- Page xii --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="pagexii"></a>[xii]</span>know the moral antecedents of the world in
  which it developed."</p>

  <p>M. Cumont is therefore a contributor to our appreciation of the
  continuity of history. Christianity was not a sudden and miraculous
  transformation, but a composite of slow and laborious growth. Its four
  centuries of struggle were not a struggle against an entirely unworthy
  religion, else would our faith in its divine warrant be diminished; it is
  to its own great credit, and also to the credit of the opponents that
  succumbed to it, that it finally overwhelmed them. To quote Emil Aust:
  "Christianity did not wake into being the religious sense, but it
  afforded that sense the fullest opportunity of being satisfied; and
  paganism fell because the less perfect must give place to the more
  perfect, not because it was sunken in sin and vice. It had out of its own
  strength laid out the ways by which it advanced to lose itself in the
  arms of Christianity, and to recognize this does not mean to minimize the
  significance of Christianity. We are under no necessity of artificially
  darkening the heathen world; the light of the Evangel streams into it
  brightly enough without this."<a name="NtA_2"
  href="#Nt_2"><sup>[2]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Finally, the work of M. Cumont and others in the field of the ancient
  Oriental religions is not an isolated activity, but part of a larger
  intellectual movement. Their effort is only one manifestation of the
  interest of recent years in the study of universal religion; other
  manifestations of the same interest are to be seen in the histories of
  the Greek and Roman religions by <!-- Page xiii --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="pagexiii"></a>[xiii]</span>Gruppe, Farnell, and
  Wissowa, in the anthropological labors of Tylor, Lang, and Frazer, in the
  publication of Reinach's <i>Orpheus</i>, in the study of comparative
  religion, and in such a phenomenon as a World's Parliament of
  Religions.</p>

  <p>In a word, M. Cumont and his companion ancient Orientalists are but
  one brigade engaged in the modern campaign for the liberation of
  religious thought. His studies are therefore not concerned alone with
  paganism, nor alone with the religions of the ancient past; in common
  with the labors of students of modern religion, they touch our own faith
  and our own times, and are in vital relation with our philosophy of
  living, and consequently with our highest welfare. "To us moderns," says
  Professor Frazer in the preface to his <i>Golden Bough</i>, "a still
  wider vista is vouchsafed, a greater panorama is unrolled by the study
  which aims at bringing home to us the faith and the practice, the hopes
  and the ideals, not of two highly gifted races only, but of all mankind,
  and thus at enabling us to follow the long march, the slow and toilsome
  ascent, of humanity from savagery to civilization.... But the comparative
  study of the beliefs and institutions of mankind is fitted to be much
  more than a means of satisfying an enlightened curiosity and of
  furnishing materials for the researches of the learned. Well handled, it
  may become a powerful instrument to expedite progress...."</p>

  <p>It is possible that all this might disquiet the minds of those who
  have been wont to assume perfection in the primitive Christian church,
  and who assume also that present-day Christianity is the ultimate form of
  the Christian religion. Such persons&mdash;if there are <!-- Page xiv
  --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="pagexiv"></a>[xiv]</span>such&mdash;should rather take heart from
  the whole-souled devotion to truth everywhere to be seen in the works of
  scholars in ancient religion, and from their equally evident sympathy
  with all manifestations of human effort to establish the divine relation;
  but most of all from their universal testimony that for all time and in
  all places and under all conditions the human heart has felt powerfully
  the need of the divine relation. From the knowledge that the desire to
  get right with God&mdash;the common and essential element in all
  religions&mdash;has been the most universal and the most potent and
  persistent factor in past history, it is not far to the conviction that
  it will always continue to be so, and that the struggle toward the divine
  light of religion pure and undefiled will never perish from the
  earth.</p>

<h3>PREFACE.</h3>

  <p>In November, 1905, the Collège de France honored the writer by asking
  him to succeed M. Naville in opening the series of lectures instituted by
  the Michonis foundation. A few months later the "Hibbert Trust" invited
  him to Oxford to develop certain subjects which he had touched upon at
  Paris. In this volume have been collected the contents of both series
  with the addition of a short bibliography and notes intended for scholars
  desirous of verifying assertions made in the text.<a name="NtAP_1"
  href="#NtP_1"><sup>[1]</sup></a> The form of the work has scarcely been
  changed, but we trust that these pages, intended though they were for
  oral delivery, will bear reading, and that the title of these studies
  will not seem too ambitious for what they have to offer. The propagation
  of the Oriental religions, with the development of neo-Platonism, is the
  leading fact in the moral history of the pagan empire. May this small
  volume on a great subject throw at least some light upon this truth, and
  may the reader receive these essays with the same kind interest shown by
  the audiences at Paris and Oxford.</p>

  <p>The reader will please remember that the different chapters were
  thought out and written as lectures. They do not claim to contain a debit
  and credit account of what the Latin paganism borrowed from or loaned to
  the Orient. Certain well-known facts have been <!-- Page xvi --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="pagexvi"></a>[xvi]</span>deliberately passed
  over in order to make room for others that are perhaps less known. We
  have taken liberties with our subject matter that would not be tolerated
  in a didactic treatise, but to which surely no one will object.</p>

  <p>We are more likely to be reproached for an apparently serious
  omission. We have investigated only the internal development of paganism
  in the Latin world, and have considered its relation to Christianity only
  incidentally and by the way. The question is nevertheless important and
  has been the subject of celebrated lectures as well as of learned
  monographs and widely distributed manuals.<a name="NtAP_2"
  href="#NtP_2"><sup>[2]</sup></a> We wish to slight neither the interest
  nor the importance of that controversy, and it is not because it seemed
  negligible that we have not entered into it.</p>

  <p>By reason of their intellectual bent and education the theologians
  were for a long time more inclined to consider the continuity of the
  Jewish tradition than the causes that disturbed it; but a reaction has
  taken place, and to-day they endeavor to show that the church has
  borrowed considerably from the conceptions and ritualistic ceremonies of
  the pagan mysteries. In spite of the prestige that surrounded Eleusis,
  the word "mysteries" calls up Hellenized Asia rather than Greece proper,
  because in the first place the earliest Christian communities were
  founded, formed and developed in the heart of Oriental populations,
  Semites, Phrygians and Egyptians. Moreover the religions of those people
  were much farther advanced, much richer in ideas and sentiments, more
  striking and stirring than the Greco-Latin anthropomorphism. Their
  liturgy always derives its inspiration from generally accepted beliefs
  <!-- Page xvii --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="pagexvii"></a>[xvii]</span>about purification embodied in certain
  acts regarded as sanctifying. These facts were almost identical in the
  various sects. The new faith poured its revelation into the hallowed
  moulds of earlier religions because in that form alone could the world in
  which it developed receive its message.</p>

  <p>This is approximately the point of view adopted by the latest
  historians.</p>

  <p>But, however absorbing this important problem may be, we could not
  think of going into it, even briefly, in these studies on Roman paganism.
  In the Latin world the question assumes much more modest proportions, and
  its aspect changes completely. Here Christianity spread only after it had
  outgrown the embryonic state and really became established. Moreover like
  Christianity the Oriental mysteries at Rome remained for a long time
  chiefly the religion of a foreign minority. Did any exchange take place
  between these rival sects? The silence of the ecclesiastical writers is
  not sufficient reason for denying it. We dislike to acknowledge a debt to
  our adversaries, because it means that we recognize some value in the
  cause they defend, but I believe that the importance of these exchanges
  should not be exaggerated. Without a doubt certain ceremonies and
  holidays of the church were based on pagan models. In the fourth century
  Christmas was placed on the 25th of December because on that date was
  celebrated the birth of the sun (<i>Natalis Invicti</i>) who was born to
  a new life each year after the solstice.<a name="NtAP_3"
  href="#NtP_3"><sup>[3]</sup></a> Certain vestiges of the religions of
  Isis and Cybele besides other polytheistic practices perpetuated
  themselves in the adoration of local saints. On the other hand as soon as
  Christianity became a moral power in <!-- Page xviii --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="pagexviii"></a>[xviii]</span>the world, it
  imposed itself even on its enemies. The Phrygian priests of the Great
  Mother openly opposed their celebration of the vernal equinox to the
  Christian Easter, and attributed to the blood shed in the taurobolium the
  redemptive power of the blood of the divine Lamb.<a name="NtAP_4"
  href="#NtP_4"><sup>[4]</sup></a></p>

  <p>All these facts constitute a series of very delicate problems of
  chronology and interrelation, and it would be rash to attempt to solve
  them <i>en bloc</i>. Probably there is a different answer in each
  particular case, and I am afraid that some cases must always remain
  unsolved. We may speak of "vespers of Isis" or of a "eucharist of Mithra
  and his companions," but only in the same sense as when we say "the
  vassal princes of the empire" or "Diocletian's socialism." These are
  tricks of style used to give prominence to a similarity and to establish
  a parallel strongly and closely. A word is not a demonstration, and we
  must be careful not to infer an influence from an analogy. Preconceived
  notions are always the most serious obstacles to an exact knowledge of
  the past. Some modern writers, like the ancient Church Fathers, are fain
  to see a sacrilegious parody inspired by the spirit of lies in the
  resemblance between the mysteries and the church ceremonies. Other
  historians seem disposed to agree with the Oriental priests, who claimed
  priority for their cults at Rome, and saw a plagiarism of their ancient
  rituals in the Christian ceremonies. It would appear that both are very
  much mistaken. Resemblance does not necessarily presuppose imitation, and
  frequently a similarity of ideas and practices must be explained by
  common origin, exclusive of any borrowing. <!-- Page xix --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="pagexix"></a>[xix]</span></p>

  <p>An illustration will make my thought clearer. The votaries of Mithra
  likened the practice of their religion to military service. When the
  neophyte joined he was compelled to take an oath (<i>sacramentum</i>)
  similar to the one required of recruits in the army, and there is no
  doubt that an indelible mark was likewise branded on his body with a hot
  iron. The third degree of the mystical hierarchy was that of "soldier"
  (<i>miles</i>). Thenceforward the initiate belonged to the sacred militia
  of the invincible god and fought the powers of evil under his orders. All
  these ideas and institutions are so much in accord with what we know of
  Mazdean dualism, in which the entire life was conceived as a struggle
  against the malevolent spirits; they are so inseparable from the history
  even of Mithraism, which always was a soldiers' religion, that we cannot
  doubt they belonged to it before its appearance in the Occident.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, we find similar conceptions in Christianity. The
  society of the faithful&mdash;the term is still in use&mdash;is the
  "Church Militant." During the first centuries the comparison of the
  church with an army was carried out even in details;<a name="NtAP_5"
  href="#NtP_5"><sup>[5]</sup></a> the baptism of the neophyte was the oath
  of fidelity to the flag taken by the recruits. Christ was the "emperor,"
  the commander-in-chief, of his disciples, who formed cohorts triumphing
  under his command over the demons; the apostates were deserters; the
  sanctuaries, camps; the pious practices, drills and sentry-duty, and so
  on.</p>

  <p>If we consider that the gospel preached peace, that for a long time
  the Christians felt a repugnance to military service, where their faith
  was threatened, we are tempted to admit <i>a priori</i> an influence of
  the belligerent cult of Mithra upon Christian thought. <!-- Page xx
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="pagexx"></a>[xx]</span></p>

  <p>But this is not the case. The theme of the <i>militia Christi</i>
  appears in the oldest ecclesiastical authors, in the epistles of St.
  Clement and even in those of St. Paul. It is impossible to admit an
  imitation of the Mithraic mysteries then, because at that period they had
  no importance whatever.</p>

  <p>But if we extend our researches to the history of that notion, we
  shall find that, at least under the empire, the mystics of Isis were also
  regarded as forming sacred cohorts enlisted in the service of the
  goddess, that previously in the Stoic philosophy human existence was
  frequently likened to a campaign, and that even the astrologers called
  the man who submitted to destiny and renounced all revolt a "soldier of
  fate."<a name="NtAP_6" href="#NtP_6"><sup>[6]</sup></a></p>

  <p>This conception of life, especially of religious life, was therefore
  very popular from the beginning of our era. It was manifestly prior both
  to Christianity and to Mithraism. It developed in the military monarchies
  of the Asiatic Diadochi. Here the soldier was no longer a citizen
  defending his country, but in most instances a volunteer bound by a
  sacred vow to the person of his king. In the martial states that fought
  for the heritage of the Achemenides this personal devotion dominated or
  displaced all national feeling. We know the oaths taken by those subjects
  to their deified kings.<a name="NtAP_7" href="#NtP_7"><sup>[7]</sup></a>
  They agreed to defend and uphold them even at the cost of their own
  lives, and always to have the same friends and the same enemies as they;
  they dedicated to them not only their actions and words, but their very
  thoughts. Their duty was a complete abandonment of their personality in
  favor of those monarchs who were held the equals of the gods. The sacred
  <i>militia</i> of the mysteries was nothing but this civic <!-- Page xxi
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="pagexxi"></a>[xxi]</span>morality
  viewed from the religious standpoint. It confounded loyalty with
  piety.</p>

  <p>As we see, the researches into the doctrines or practices common to
  Christianity and the Oriental mysteries lead almost always beyond the
  limits of the Roman empire into the Hellenistic Orient. The religious
  conceptions which imposed themselves on Latin Europe under the Cæsars<a
  name="NtAP_8" href="#NtP_8"><sup>[8]</sup></a> were developed there, and
  it is there we must look for the key to enigmas still unsolved. It is
  true that at present nothing is more obscure than the history of the
  religions that arose in Asia when Greek culture came in contact with
  barbarian theology. It is rarely possible to formulate satisfactory
  conclusions with any degree of certainty, and before further discoveries
  are made we shall frequently be compelled to weigh contrasting
  probabilities. We must frequently throw out the sounding line into the
  shifting sea of possibility in order to find secure anchorage. But at any
  rate we perceive with sufficient distinctness the direction in which the
  investigations must be pursued.</p>

  <p>It is our belief that the main point to be cleared up is the composite
  religion of those Jewish or Jewish-pagan communities, the worshipers of
  Hypsistos, the Sabbatists, the Sabaziasts and others in which the new
  creed took root during the apostolic age. In those communities the Mosaic
  law had become adapted to the sacred usages of the Gentiles even before
  the beginning of our era, and monotheism had made concessions to
  idolatry. Many beliefs of the ancient Orient, as for instance the ideas
  of Persian dualism regarding the infernal world, arrived in Europe by two
  roads, the more or less orthodox Judaism of the communities of <!-- Page
  xxii --><span class="pagenum"><a name="pagexxii"></a>[xxii]</span>the
  dispersion in which the gospel was accepted immediately, and the pagan
  mysteries imported from Syria or Asia Minor. Certain similarities that
  surprised and shocked the apologists will cease to look strange as soon
  as we reach the distant sources of the channels that reunited at
  Rome.</p>

  <p>But these delicate and complicated researches into origins and
  relationships belong especially to the history of the Alexandrian period.
  In considering the Roman empire, the principal fact is that the Oriental
  religions propagated doctrines, previous to and later side by side with
  Christianity, that acquired with it universal authority at the decline of
  the ancient world. The preaching of the Asiatic priests also unwittingly
  prepared for the triumph of the church which put its stamp on the work at
  which they had unconsciously labored.</p>

  <p>Through their popular propaganda they had completely disintegrated the
  ancient national faith of the Romans, while at the same time the Cæsars
  had gradually destroyed the political particularism. After their advent
  it was no longer necessary for religion to be connected with a state in
  order to become universal. Religion was no longer regarded as a public
  duty, but as a personal obligation; no longer did it subordinate the
  individual to the city-state, but pretended above all to assure his
  welfare in this world and especially in the world to come. The Oriental
  mysteries offered their votaries radiant perspectives of eternal
  happiness. Thus the focus of morality was changed. The aim became to
  realize the sovereign good in the life hereafter instead of in this
  world, as the Greek philosophy had done. No longer did man act in view of
  tangible <!-- Page xxiii --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="pagexxiii"></a>[xxiii]</span>realities, but to attain ideal hopes.
  Existence in this life was regarded as a preparation for a sanctified
  life, as a trial whose outcome was to be either everlasting happiness or
  everlasting pain.</p>

  <p>As we see, the entire system of ethical values was overturned.</p>

  <p>The salvation of the soul, which had become the one great human care,
  was especially promised in these mysteries upon the accurate performance
  of the sacred ceremonies. The rites possessed a power of purification and
  redemption. They made man better and freed him from the dominion of
  hostile spirits. Consequently, religion was a singularly important and
  absorbing matter, and the liturgy could be performed only by a clergy
  devoting itself entirely to the task. The Asiatic gods exacted undivided
  service; their priests were no longer magistrates, scarcely citizens.
  They devoted themselves unreservedly to their ministry, and demanded of
  their adherents submission to their sacred authority.</p>

  <p>All these features that we are but sketching here, gave the Oriental
  religions a resemblance to Christianity, and the reader of these studies
  will find many more points in common among them. These analogies are even
  more striking to us than they were in those times because we have become
  acquainted in India and China with religions very different from the
  Roman paganism and from Christianity as well, and because the
  relationships of the two latter strike us more strongly on account of the
  contrast. These theological similarities did not attract the attention of
  the ancients, because they scarcely conceived of the existence of other
  possibilities, while differences were what they <!-- Page xxiv --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="pagexxiv"></a>[xxiv]</span>remarked especially.
  I am not at all forgetting how considerable these were. The principal
  divergence was that Christianity, by placing God in an ideal sphere
  beyond the confines of this world, endeavored to rid itself of every
  attachment to a frequently abject polytheism. But even if we oppose
  tradition, we cannot break with the past that has formed us, nor separate
  ourselves from the present in which we live. As the religious history of
  the empire is studied more closely, the triumph of the church will, in
  our opinion, appear more and more as the culmination of a long evolution
  of beliefs. We can understand the Christianity of the fifth century with
  its greatness and weaknesses, its spiritual exaltation and its puerile
  superstitions, if we know the moral antecedents of the world in which it
  developed. The faith of the friends of Symmachus was much farther removed
  from the religious ideal of Augustus, although they would never have
  admitted it, than that of their opponents in the senate. I hope that
  these studies will succeed in showing how the pagan religions from the
  Orient aided the long continued effort of Roman society, contented for
  many centuries with a rather insipid idolatry, toward more elevated and
  more profound forms of worship. Possibly their credulous mysticism
  deserves as much blame as is laid upon the theurgy of neo-Platonism,
  which drew from the same sources of inspiration, but like neo-Platonism
  it has strengthened man's feeling of eminent dignity by asserting the
  divine nature of the soul. By making inner purity the main object of
  earthly existence, they refined and exalted the psychic life and gave it
  an almost supernatural intensity, which until then was unknown in the
  ancient world. <!-- Page xxv --><span class="pagenum"><a

<h3>PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION.</h3>

  <p>In this second edition the eight lectures forming the reading matter
  of this book have suffered scarcely any change, and, excepting the
  chapter on Syria, the additions are insignificant. It would have been an
  easy matter to expand them, but I did not want these lectures to become
  erudite dissertations, nor the ideas which are the essential part of a
  sketch like the present to be overwhelmed by a multiplicity of facts. In
  general I have therefore limited myself to weeding out certain errors
  that were overlooked, or introduced, in the proofreading.</p>

  <p>The notes, however, have been radically revised. I have endeavored to
  give expression to the suggestions or observations communicated to me by
  obliging readers; to mention new publications and to utilize the results
  of my own studies. The index makes it easy to find the subjects
  discussed.</p>

  <p>And here I must again thank my friend Charles Michel, who undertook
  the tedious task of rereading the proofs of this book, and whose
  scrupulous and sagacious care has saved me from many and many a
  blunder.</p>

<h3>ROME AND THE ORIENT.</h3>

  <p>We are fond of regarding ourselves as the heirs of Rome, and we like
  to think that the Latin genius, after having absorbed the genius of
  Greece, held an intellectual and moral supremacy in the ancient world
  similar to the one Europe now maintains, and that the culture of the
  peoples that lived under the authority of the Cæsars was stamped forever
  by their strong touch. It is difficult to forget the present entirely and
  to renounce aristocratic pretensions. We find it hard to believe that the
  Orient has not always lived, to some extent, in the state of humiliation
  from which it is now slowly emerging, and we are inclined to ascribe to
  the ancient inhabitants of Smyrna, Beirut or Alexandria the faults with
  which the Levantines of to-day are being reproached. The growing
  influence of the Orientals that accompanied the decline of the empire has
  frequently been considered a morbid phenomenon and a symptom of the slow
  decomposition of the ancient world. Even Renan does not seem to have been
  sufficiently free from an old prejudice when he wrote on this subject:<a
  name="NtA1_1" href="#Nt1_1"><sup>[1]</sup></a> "That the oldest and most
  worn out civilization should by its corruption subjugate the younger was
  inevitable."</p>

  <p>But if we calmly consider the real facts, avoiding the optical
  illusion that makes things in our immediate <!-- Page 2 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page2"></a>[2]</span>vicinity look larger, we
  shall form a quite different opinion. It is beyond all dispute that Rome
  found the point of support of its military power in the Occident. The
  legions from the Danube and the Rhine were always braver, stronger and
  better disciplined than those from the Euphrates and the Nile. But it is
  in the Orient, especially in these countries of "old civilization," that
  we must look for industry and riches, for technical ability and artistic
  productions, as well as for intelligence and science, even before
  Constantine made it the center of political power.</p>

  <p>While Greece merely vegetated in a state of poverty, humiliation and
  exhaustion; while Italy suffered depopulation and became unable to
  provide for her own support; while the other countries of Europe were
  hardly out of barbarism; Asia Minor, Egypt and Syria gathered the rich
  harvests Roman peace made possible. Their industrial centers cultivated
  and renewed all the traditions that had caused their former celebrity. A
  more intense intellectual life corresponded with the economic activity of
  these great manufacturing and exporting countries. They excelled in every
  profession except that of arms, and even the prejudiced Romans admitted
  their superiority. The menace of an Oriental empire haunted the
  imaginations of the first masters of the world. Such an empire seems to
  have been the main thought of the dictator Cæsar, and the triumvir Antony
  almost realized it. Even Nero thought of making Alexandria his capital.
  Although Rome, supported by her army and the right of might, retained the
  political authority for a long time, she bowed to the fatal moral
  ascendency of more advanced peoples. Viewed from this standpoint the
  history of the empire <!-- Page 3 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page3"></a>[3]</span>during the first three centuries may be
  summarized as a "peaceful infiltration" of the Orient into the
  Occident.<a name="NtA1_2" href="#Nt1_2"><sup>[2]</sup></a> This truth has
  become evident since the various aspects of Roman civilization are being
  studied in greater detail; and before broaching the special subject of
  these studies we wish to review a few phases of the slow metamorphosis of
  which the propagation of the Oriental religions was one phenomenon.</p>

  <p>In the first place the imitation of the Orient showed itself plainly
  in political institutions.<a name="NtA1_3"
  href="#Nt1_3"><sup>[3]</sup></a> To be convinced of this fact it is
  sufficient to compare the government of the empire in the time of
  Augustus with what it had become under Diocletian. At the beginning of
  the imperial régime Rome ruled the world but did not govern it. She kept
  the number of her functionaries down to a minimum, her provinces were
  mere unorganized aggregates of cities where she only exercised police
  power, protectorates rather than annexed countries.<a name="NtA1_4"
  href="#Nt1_4"><sup>[4]</sup></a> As long as law and order were maintained
  and her citizens, functionaries and merchants could transact their
  business, Rome was satisfied. She saved herself the trouble of looking
  after the public service by leaving broad authority to the cities that
  had existed before her domination, or had been modeled after her. The
  taxes were levied by syndicates of bankers and the public lands rented
  out. Before the reforms instituted by Augustus, even the army was not an
  organic and permanent force, but consisted theoretically of troops levied
  before a war and discharged after victory.</p>

  <p>Rome's institutions remained those of a city. It was difficult to
  apply them to the vast territory she attempted to govern with their aid.
  They were a clumsy <!-- Page 4 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page4"></a>[4]</span>apparatus that worked only by sudden starts, a
  rudimentary system that could not and did not last.</p>

  <p>What do we find three centuries later? A strongly centralized state in
  which an absolute ruler, worshiped like a god and surrounded by a large
  court, commanded a whole hierarchy of functionaries; cities divested of
  their local liberties and ruled by an omnipotent bureaucracy, the old
  capital herself the first to be dispossessed of her autonomy and
  subjected to prefects. Outside of the cities the monarch, whose private
  fortune was identical with the state finances, possessed immense domains
  managed by intendants and supporting a population of serf-colonists. The
  army was composed largely of foreign mercenaries, professional soldiers
  whose pay or bounty consisted of lands on which they settled. All these
  features and many others caused the Roman empire to assume the likeness
  of ancient Oriental monarchies.</p>

  <p>It would be impossible to admit that like causes produce like results,
  and then maintain that a similarity is not sufficient proof of an
  influence in history. Wherever we can closely follow the successive
  transformations of a particular institution, we notice the action of the
  Orient and especially of Egypt. When Rome had become a great cosmopolitan
  metropolis like Alexandria, Augustus reorganized it in imitation of the
  capital of the Ptolemies. The fiscal reforms of the Cæsars like the taxes
  on sales and inheritances, the register of land surveys and the direct
  collection of taxes, were suggested by the very perfect financial system
  of the Lagides,<a name="NtA1_5" href="#Nt1_5"><sup>[5]</sup></a> and it
  can be maintained that their government was the first source from which
  those of modern Europe were derived, through the medium <!-- Page 5
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page5"></a>[5]</span>of the Romans. The
  imperial <i>saltus</i>, superintended by a procurator and cultivated by
  metayers reduced to the state of serfs, was an imitation of the ones that
  the Asiatic potentates formerly cultivated through their agents.<a
  name="NtA1_6" href="#Nt1_6"><sup>[6]</sup></a> It would be easy to
  increase this list of examples. The absolute monarchy, theocratic and
  bureaucratic at the same time, that was the form of government of Egypt,
  Syria and even Asia Minor during the Alexandrine period was the ideal on
  which the deified Cæsars gradually fashioned the Roman empire.</p>

  <p>One cannot however deny Rome the glory of having elaborated a system
  of private law that was logically deduced from clearly formulated
  principles and was destined to become the fundamental law of all
  civilized communities. But even in connection with this private law,
  where the originality of Rome is uncontested and her preeminence
  absolute, recent researches have shown with how much tenacity the
  Hellenized Orient maintained its old legal codes, and how much resistance
  local customs, the woof of the life of nations, offered to unification.
  In truth, unification never was realized except in theory.<a
  name="NtA1_7" href="#Nt1_7"><sup>[7]</sup></a> More than that, these
  researches have proved that the fertile principles of that provincial
  law, which was sometimes on a higher moral plane than the Roman law,
  reacted on the progressive transformation of the old <i>ius civile</i>.
  And how could it be otherwise? Were not a great number of famous jurists
  like Ulpian of Tyre and Papinian of Hemesa natives of Syria? And did not
  the law-school of Beirut constantly grow in importance after the third
  century, until during the fifth century it became the most brilliant
  center of legal education? Thus Levantines <!-- Page 6 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page6"></a>[6]</span>cultivated even the
  patrimonial field cleared by Scaevola and Labeo.<a name="NtA1_8"
  href="#Nt1_8"><sup>[8]</sup></a></p>

  <p>In the austere temple of law the Orient held as yet only a minor
  position; everywhere else its authority was predominant. The practical
  mind of the Romans, which made them excellent lawyers, prevented them
  from becoming great scholars. They esteemed pure science but little,
  having small talent for it, and one notices that it ceased to be
  earnestly cultivated wherever their direct domination was established.
  The great astronomers, mathematicians, and physicians, like the
  originators or defenders of the great metaphysical systems, were mostly
  Orientals. Ptolemy and Plotinus were Egyptians, Porphyry and Iamblichus,
  Syrians, Dioscorides and Galen, Asiatics. All branches of learning were
  affected by the spirit of the Orient. The clearest minds accepted the
  chimeras of astrology and magic. Philosophy claimed more and more to
  derive its inspiration from the fabulous wisdom of Chaldea and Egypt.
  Tired of seeking truth, reason abdicated and hoped to find it in a
  revelation preserved in the mysteries of the barbarians. Greek logic
  strove to coordinate into an harmonious whole the confused traditions of
  the Asiatic religions.</p>

  <p>Letters, as well as science, were cultivated chiefly by the Orientals.
  Attention has often been called to the fact that those men of letters
  that were considered the purest representatives of the Greek spirit under
  the empire belonged almost without exception to Asia Minor, Syria or
  Egypt. The rhetorician Dion Chrysostom came from Prusa in Bithynia, the
  satirist Lucian from Samosata in Commagene on the borders of the
  Euphrates. A number of other names could be cited. <!-- Page 7 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page7"></a>[7]</span>From Tacitus and Suetonius
  down to Ammianus, there was not one author of talent to preserve in Latin
  the memory of the events that stirred the world of that period, but it
  was a Bithynian again, Dion Cassius of Nicea, who, under the Severi,
  narrated the history of the Roman people.</p>

  <p>It is a characteristic fact that, besides this literature whose
  language was Greek, others were born, revived and developed. The Syriac,
  derived from the Aramaic which was the international language of earlier
  Asia, became again the language of a cultured race with Bardesanes of
  Edessa. The Copts remembered that they had spoken several dialects
  derived from the ancient Egyptian and endeavored to revive them. North of
  the Taurus even the Armenians began to write and polish their barbarian
  speech. Christian preaching, addressed to the people, took hold of the
  popular idioms and roused them from their long lethargy. Along the Nile
  as well as on the plains of Mesopotamia or in the valleys of Anatolia it
  proclaimed its new ideas in dialects that had been despised hitherto, and
  wherever the old Orient had not been entirely denationalized by
  Hellenism, it successfully reclaimed its intellectual autonomy.</p>

  <p>A revival of native art went hand in hand with this linguistic
  awakening. In no field of intellect has the illusion mentioned above been
  so complete and lasting as in this one. Until a few years ago the opinion
  prevailed that an "imperial" art had come into existence in the Rome of
  Augustus and that thence its predominance had slowly spread to the
  periphery of the ancient world. If it had undergone some special
  modifications in Asia these were due to exotic influences, undoubtedly
  <!-- Page 8 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page8"></a>[8]</span>Assyrian or Persian. Not even the important
  discoveries of M. de Vogüé in Hauran<a name="NtA1_9"
  href="#Nt1_9"><sup>[9]</sup></a> were sufficient to prove the emptiness
  of a theory that was supported by our lofty conviction of European
  leadership.</p>

  <p>To-day it is fully proven not only that Rome has given nothing or
  almost nothing to the Orientals but also that she has received quite a
  little from them. Impregnated with Hellenism, Asia produced an
  astonishing number of original works of art in the kingdoms of the
  Diadochs. The old processes, the discovery of which dates back to the
  Chaldeans, the Hittites or the subjects of the Pharaohs, were first
  utilized by the conquerors of Alexander's empire who conceived a rich
  variety of new types, and created an original style. But if during the
  three centuries preceding our era, sovereign Greece played the part of
  the demiurge who creates living beings out of preexisting matter, during
  the three following centuries her productive power became exhausted, her
  faculty of invention weakened, the ancient local traditions revolted
  against her empire and with the help of Christianity overcame it.
  Transferred to Byzantium they expanded in a new efflorescence and spread
  over Europe where they paved the way for the formation of the Romanesque
  art of the early Middle Ages.<a name="NtA1_10"
  href="#Nt1_10"><sup>[10]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Rome, then, far from having established her suzerainty, was tributary
  to the Orient in this respect. The Orient was her superior in the extent
  and precision of its technical knowledge as well as in the inventive
  genius and ability of its workmen. The Cæsars were great builders but
  frequently employed foreign help. Trajan's principal architect, a
  magnificent builder, was a Syrian, Apollodorus of Damascus.<a
  name="NtA1_11" href="#Nt1_11"><sup>[11]</sup></a> <!-- Page 9 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page9"></a>[9]</span></p>

  <p>Her Levantine subjects not only taught Italy the artistic solution of
  architectonic problems like the erection of a cupola on a rectangular or
  octagonal edifice, but also compelled her to accept their taste, and they
  saturated her with their genius. They imparted to her their love of
  luxuriant decoration, and of violent polychromy, and they gave religious
  sculpture and painting the complicated symbolism that pleased their
  abstruse and subtle minds.</p>

  <p>In those times art was closely connected with industry, which was
  entirely manual and individual. They learned from each other, they
  improved and declined together, in short they were inseparable. Shall we
  call the painters that decorated the architecturally fantastic and airy
  walls of Pompeii in Alexandrian or perhaps Syrian taste artisans or
  artists? And how shall we classify the goldsmiths, Alexandrians also, who
  carved those delicate leaves, those picturesque animals, those
  harmoniously elegant or cunningly animated groups that cover the phials
  and goblets of Bosco Reale? And descending from the productions of the
  industrial arts to those of industry itself, one might also trace the
  growing influence of the Orient; one might show how the action of the
  great manufacturing centers of the East gradually transformed the
  material civilization of Europe; one might point out how the introduction
  into Gaul<a name="NtA1_12" href="#Nt1_12"><sup>[12]</sup></a> of exotic
  patterns and processes changed the old native industry and gave its
  products a perfection and a popularity hitherto unknown. But I dislike to
  insist overmuch on a point apparently so foreign to the one now before
  us. It was important however to mention this subject at the beginning
  because in whatever direction scholars of <!-- Page 10 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page10"></a>[10]</span>to-day pursue their
  investigations they always notice Asiatic culture slowly supplanting that
  of Italy. The latter developed only by absorbing elements taken from the
  inexhaustible reserves of the "old civilizations" of which we spoke at
  the beginning. The Hellenized Orient imposed itself everywhere through
  its men and its works; it subjected its Latin conquerors to its
  ascendancy in the same manner as it dominated its Arabian conquerors
  later when it became the civilizer of Islam. But in no field of thought
  was its influence, under the empire, so decisive as in religion, because
  it finally brought about the complete destruction of the Greco-Latin
  paganism.<a name="NtA1_13" href="#Nt1_13"><sup>[13]</sup></a></p>

  <p>The invasion of the barbarian religions was so open, so noisy and so
  triumphant that it could not remain unnoticed. It attracted the anxious
  or sympathetic attention of the ancient authors, and since the
  Renaissance modern scholars have frequently taken interest in it.
  Possibly however they did not sufficiently understand that this religious
  evolution was not an isolated and extraordinary phenomenon, but that it
  accompanied and aided a more general evolution, just as that aided it in
  turn. The transformation of beliefs was intimately connected with the
  establishment of the monarchy by divine right, the development of art,
  the prevailing philosophic tendencies, in fact with all the
  manifestations of thought, sentiment and taste.</p>

  <p>We shall attempt to sketch this religious movement with its numerous
  and far-reaching ramifications. First we shall try to show what caused
  the diffusion of the Oriental religions. In the second place we shall
  examine those in particular that originated in Asia Minor, Egypt, Syria
  and Persia, and we shall endeavor to <!-- Page 11 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page11"></a>[11]</span>distinguish their
  individual characteristics and estimate their value. We shall see,
  finally, how the ancient idolatry was transformed and what form it
  assumed in its last struggle against Christianity, whose victory was
  furthered by Asiatic mysteries, although they opposed its doctrine.</p>

<hr class="short" >

  <p>But before broaching this subject a preliminary question must be
  answered. Is the study which we have just outlined possible? What items
  will be of assistance to us in this undertaking? From what sources are we
  to derive our knowledge of the Oriental religions in the Roman
  empire?</p>

  <p>It must be admitted that the sources are inadequate and have not as
  yet been sufficiently investigated.</p>

  <p>Perhaps no loss caused by the general wreck of ancient literature has
  been more disastrous than that of the liturgic books of paganism. A few
  mystic formulas quoted incidentally by pagan or Christian authors and a
  few fragments of hymns in honor of the gods<a name="NtA1_14"
  href="#Nt1_14"><sup>[14]</sup></a> are practically all that escaped
  destruction. In order to obtain an idea of what those lost rituals may
  have been one must turn to their imitations contained in the chorus of
  tragedies, and to the parodies comic authors sometimes made; or look up
  in books of magic the plagiarisms that writers of incantations may have
  committed.<a name="NtA1_15" href="#Nt1_15"><sup>[15]</sup></a> But all
  this gives us only a dim reflection of the religious ceremonies. Shut out
  from the sanctuary like profane outsiders, we hear only the indistinct
  echo of the sacred songs and not even in imagination can we attend the
  celebration of the mysteries.</p>

  <p>We do not know how the ancients prayed, we cannot penetrate into the
  intimacy of their religious life, <!-- Page 12 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page12"></a>[12]</span>and certain depths of the
  soul of antiquity we must leave unsounded. If a fortunate windfall could
  give us possession of some sacred book of the later paganism its
  revelations would surprise the world. We could witness the performance of
  those mysterious dramas whose symbolic acts commemorated the passion of
  the gods; in company with the believers we could sympathize with their
  sufferings, lament their death and share in the joy of their return to
  life. In those vast collections of archaic rites that hazily perpetuated
  the memory of abolished creeds we would find traditional formulas couched
  in obsolete language that was scarcely understood, naive prayers
  conceived by the faith of the earliest ages, sanctified by the devotion
  of past centuries, and almost ennobled by the joys and sufferings of past
  generations. We would also read those hymns in which philosophic thought
  found expression in sumptuous allegories<a name="NtA1_16"
  href="#Nt1_16"><sup>[16]</sup></a> or humbled itself before the
  omnipotence of the infinite, poems of which only a few stoic effusions
  celebrating the creative or destructive fire, or expressing a complete
  surrender to divine fate can give us some idea.<a name="NtA1_17"
  href="#Nt1_17"><sup>[17]</sup></a></p>

  <p>But everything is gone, and thus we lose the possibility of studying
  from the original documents the internal development of the pagan
  religions.</p>

  <p>We should feel this loss less keenly if we possessed at least the
  works of Greek and Latin mythographers on the subject of foreign
  divinities like the voluminous books published during the second century
  by Eusebius and Pallas on the Mysteries of Mithra. But those works were
  thought devoid of interest or even dangerous by the devout Middle Ages,
  and they are not likely to have survived the fall of paganism. The <!--
  Page 13 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page13"></a>[13]</span>treatises on mythology that have been
  preserved deal almost entirely with the ancient Hellenic fables made
  famous by the classic writers, to the neglect of the Oriental
  religions.<a name="NtA1_18" href="#Nt1_18"><sup>[18]</sup></a></p>

  <p>As a rule, all we find in literature on this subject are a few
  incidental remarks and passing allusions. History is incredibly poor in
  that respect. This poverty of information was caused in the first place
  by a narrowness of view characteristic of the rhetoric cultivated by
  historians of the classical period and especially of the empire. Politics
  and the wars of the rulers, the dramas, the intrigues and even the gossip
  of the courts and of the official world were of much higher interest to
  them than the great economic or religious transformations. Moreover,
  there is no period of the Roman empire concerning which we are so little
  informed as the third century, precisely the one during which the
  Oriental religions reached the apogee of their power. From Herodianus and
  Dion Cassius to the Byzantines, and from Suetonius to Ammianus
  Marcellinus, all narratives of any importance have been lost, and this
  deplorable blank in historic tradition is particularly fatal to the study
  of paganism.</p>

  <p>It is a strange fact that light literature concerned itself more with
  these grave questions. The rites of the exotic religions stimulated the
  imagination of the satirists, and the pomp of the festivities furnished
  the novelists with brilliant descriptive matter. Juvenal laughs at the
  mortifications of the devotees of Isis; in his <i>Necromancy</i> Lucian
  parodies the interminable purifications of the magi, and in the
  <i>Metamorphoses</i> Apuleius relates the various scenes of an initiation
  into the mysteries of Isis with the fervor of a neophyte and <!-- Page 14
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page14"></a>[14]</span>the studied
  refinement of a rhetorician. But as a rule we find only incidental
  remarks and superficial observations in the authors. Not even the
  precious treatise <i>On the Syrian Goddess</i>, in which Lucian tells of
  a visit to the temple of Hierapolis and repeats his conversation with the
  priests, has any depth. What he relates is the impression of an
  intelligent, curious and above all an ironical traveler.<a name="NtA1_19"
  href="#Nt1_19"><sup>[19]</sup></a></p>

  <p>In order to obtain a more perfect initiation and a less fragmentary
  insight into the doctrines taught by the Oriental religions, we are
  compelled to turn to two kinds of testimony, inspired by contrary
  tendencies, but equally suspicious: the testimony of the philosophers,
  and that of the fathers of the church. The Stoics and the Platonists
  frequently took an interest in the religious beliefs of the barbarians,
  and it is to them that we are indebted for the possession of highly
  valuable data on this subject. Plutarch's treatise <i>Isis and Osiris</i>
  is a source whose importance is appreciated even by Egyptologists, whom
  it aids in reconstructing the legends of those divinities.<a
  name="NtA1_20" href="#Nt1_20"><sup>[20]</sup></a> But the philosophers
  very seldom expounded foreign doctrines objectively and for their own
  sake. They embodied them in their systems as a means of proof or
  illustration; they surrounded them with personal exegesis or drowned them
  in transcendental commentaries; in short, they claimed to discover their
  own ideas in them. It is always difficult and sometimes impossible to
  distinguish the dogmas from the self-confident interpretations which are
  usually as incorrect as possible.</p>

  <p>The writings of the ecclesiastical authors, although prejudiced, are
  very fertile sources of information, but in perusing them one must guard
  against another kind <!-- Page 15 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page15"></a>[15]</span>of error. By a peculiar irony of fate those
  controversialists are to-day in many instances our only aid in reviving
  the idolatry they attempted to destroy. Although the Oriental religions
  were the most dangerous and most persistent adversaries of Christianity,
  the works of the Christian writers do not supply as abundant information
  as one might suppose. The reason for this is that the fathers of the
  church often show a certain reserve in speaking of idolatry, and affect
  to recall its monstrosities only in guarded terms. Moreover, as we shall
  see later on,<a name="NtA1_21" href="#Nt1_21"><sup>[21]</sup></a> the
  apologists of the fourth century were frequently behind the times as to
  the evolution of doctrines, and drawing on literary tradition, from
  epicureans and skeptics, they fought especially the beliefs of the
  ancient Grecian and Italian religions that had been abolished or were
  dying out, while they neglected the living beliefs of the contemporary
  world.</p>

  <p>Some of these polemicists nevertheless directed their attacks against
  the divinities of the Orient and their Latin votaries. Either they
  derived their information from converts or they had been pagans
  themselves during their youth. This was the case with Firmicus Maternus
  who has written a bad treatise on astrology and finally fought the
  <i>Error of the Profane Religions</i>. However, the question always
  arises as to how much they can have known of the esoteric doctrines and
  the ritual ceremonies, the secret of which was jealously guarded. They
  boast so loudly of their power to disclose these abominations, that they
  incur the suspicion that the discretion of the initiates baffled their
  curiosity. In addition they were too ready to believe all the calumnies
  that were circulated against the pagan mysteries, <!-- Page 16 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page16"></a>[16]</span>calumnies directed
  against occult sects of all times and against the Christians
  themselves.</p>

  <p>In short, the literary tradition is not very rich and frequently
  little worthy of belief. While it is comparatively considerable for the
  Egyptian religions because they were received by the Greek world as early
  as the period of the Ptolemies, and because letters and science were
  always cultivated at Alexandria, it is even less important for Phrygia,
  although Cybele was Hellenized and Latinized very early, and excepting
  the tract by Lucian on the goddess of Hierapolis it is almost nothing for
  the Syrian, Cappadocian and Persian religions.</p>

  <p>The insufficiency of the data supplied by writers increases the value
  of information furnished by epigraphic and archeological documents, whose
  number is steadily growing. The inscriptions possess a certainty and
  precision that is frequently absent in the phrases of the writers. They
  enable one to draw important conclusions as to the dates of propagation
  and disappearance of the various religions, their extent, the quality and
  social rank of their votaries, the sacred hierarchy and sacerdotal
  personnel, the constitution of the religious communities, the offerings
  made to the gods, and the ceremonies performed in their honor; in short,
  conclusions as to the secular and profane history of these religions, and
  in a certain measure their ritual. But the conciseness of the lapidary
  style and the constant repetition of stereotyped formulas naturally
  render that kind of text hardly explicit and sometimes enigmatical. There
  are dedications like the <i>Nama Sebesio</i> engraved upon the great
  Mithra bas-relief preserved in the Louvre, that caused a number of <!--
  Page 17 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page17"></a>[17]</span>dissertations to be written without any one
  explaining it. And besides, in a general way, epigraphy gives us but
  little information about the liturgy and almost nothing regarding the
  doctrines.</p>

  <p>Archeology must endeavor to fill the enormous blanks left by the
  written tradition; the monuments, especially the artistic ones, have not
  as yet been collected with sufficient care nor interpreted with
  sufficient method. By studying the arrangement of the temples and the
  religious furniture that adorned them, one can at the same time determine
  part of the liturgic ceremonies which took place there. On the other
  hand, the critical interpretation of statuary relics enables us to
  reconstruct with sufficient correctness certain sacred legends and to
  recover part of the theology of the mysteries. Unlike Greek art, the
  religious art at the close of paganism did not seek, or sought only
  incidentally, to elevate the soul through the contemplation of an ideal
  of divine beauty. True to the traditions of the ancient Orient, it tried
  to edify and to instruct at the same time.<a name="NtA1_22"
  href="#Nt1_22"><sup>[22]</sup></a> It told the history of the gods and
  the world in cycles of pictures, or it expressed through symbols the
  subtle conceptions of theology and even certain doctrines of profane
  science, like the struggle of the four elements; just as during the
  Middle Ages, so the artist of the empire interpreted the ideas of the
  clergy, teaching the believers by means of pictures and rendering the
  highest religious conceptions intelligible to the humblest minds. But to
  read this mystic book whose pages are scattered in our museums we must
  laboriously look for its key, and we cannot take for a guide and
  exegetist some Vincent de Beauvais of Diocletian's period<a
  name="NtA1_23" href="#Nt1_23"><sup>[23]</sup></a> as when looking over
  the marvelous <!-- Page 18 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page18"></a>[18]</span>sculptured encyclopedias in our Gothic
  cathedrals. Our position is frequently similar to that of a scholar of
  the year 4000 who would undertake to write the history of the Passion
  from the pictures of the fourteen stations, or to study the veneration of
  the saints from the statues found in the ruins of our churches.</p>

  <p>But, as far as the Oriental religions are concerned, the results of
  all the laborious investigations now being made in the classical
  countries can be indirectly controlled, and this is a great advantage.
  To-day we are tolerably well acquainted with the old religions of Egypt,
  Babylonia and Persia. We read and translate correctly the hieroglyphics
  of the Nile, the cuneiform tablets of Mesopotamia and the sacred books,
  Zend or Pahlavi, of Parseeism. Religious history has profited more by
  their deciphering than the history of politics or of civilization. In
  Syria also, the discovery of Aramaic and Ph&oelig;nician inscriptions and
  the excavations made in temples have in a certain measure covered the
  deficiency of information in the Bible or in the Greek writers on Semitic
  paganism. Even Asia Minor, that is to say the uplands of Anatolia, is
  beginning to reveal herself to explorers although almost all the great
  sanctuaries, Pessinus, the two Comanas, Castabala, are as yet buried
  underground. We can, therefore, even now form a fairly exact idea of the
  beliefs of some of the countries that sent the Oriental mysteries to
  Rome. To tell the truth, these researches have not been pushed far enough
  to enable us to state precisely what form religion had assumed in those
  regions at the time they came into contact with Italy, and we should be
  likely to commit very strange errors, if we brought together practices
  that may have been <!-- Page 19 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page19"></a>[19]</span>separated by thousands of years. It is a
  task reserved for the future to establish a rigorous chronology in this
  matter, to determine the ultimate phase that the evolution of creeds in
  all regions of the Levant had reached at the beginning of our era, and to
  connect them without interruption of continuity to the mysteries
  practiced in the Latin world, the secrets of which archeological
  researches are slowly bringing to light.</p>

  <p>We are still far from welding all the links of this long chain firmly
  together; the orientalists and the classical philologists cannot, as yet,
  shake hands across the Mediterranean. We raise only one corner of Isis's
  veil, and scarcely guess a part of the revelations that were, even
  formerly, reserved for a pious and chosen few. Nevertheless we have
  reached, on the road of certainty, a summit from which we can overlook
  the field that our successors will clear. In the course of these lectures
  I shall attempt to give a summary of the essential results achieved by
  the erudition of the nineteenth century and to draw from them a few
  conclusions that will, possibly, be provisional. The invasion of the
  Oriental religions that destroyed the ancient religions and national
  ideals of the Romans also radically transformed the society and
  government of the empire, and in view of this fact it would deserve the
  historian's attention even if it had not foreshadowed and prepared the
  final victory of Christianity.</p>

<h3>WHY THE ORIENTAL RELIGIONS SPREAD.</h3>

  <p>When, during the fourth century, the weakened empire split asunder
  like an overburdened scale whose beam is broken, this political divorce
  perpetuated a moral separation that had existed for a long time. The
  opposition between the Greco-Oriental and the Latin worlds manifests
  itself especially in religion and in the attitude taken by the central
  power toward it.</p>

  <p>Occidental paganism was almost exclusively Latin under the empire.
  After the annexation of Spain, Gaul and Brittany, the old Iberian, Celtic
  and other religions were unable to keep up the unequal struggle against
  the more advanced religion of the conquerors. The marvelous rapidity with
  which the literature of the civilizing Romans was accepted by the subject
  peoples has frequently been pointed out. Its influence was felt in the
  temples as well as in the forum; it transformed the prayers to the gods
  as well as the conversation between men. Besides, it was part of the
  political program of the Cæsars to make the adoption of the Roman
  divinities general, and the government imposed the rules of its
  sacerdotal law as well as the principles of its public and civil law upon
  its new subjects. The municipal laws prescribed the election of pontiffs
  and augurs in common with the judicial duumvirs. In Gaul druidism, with
  its oral traditions embodied in <!-- Page 21 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page21"></a>[21]</span>long poems, perished and disappeared less on
  account of the police measures directed against it than in consequence of
  its voluntary relinquishment by the Celts, as soon as they came under the
  ascendency of Latin culture. In Spain it is difficult to find any traces
  of the aboriginal religions. Even in Africa, where the Punic religion was
  far more developed, it maintained itself only by assuming an entirely
  Roman appearance. Baal became Saturn and Eshmoun Æsculapius. It is
  doubtful if there was one temple in all the provinces of Italy and Gaul
  where, at the time of the disappearance of idolatry, the ceremonies were
  celebrated according to native rites and in the local idiom. To this
  exclusive predominance of Latin is due the fact that it remained the only
  liturgic language of the Occidental church, which here as in many other
  cases perpetuated a preexisting condition and maintained a unity
  previously established. By imposing her speech upon the inhabitants of
  Ireland and Germany, Christian Rome simply continued the work of
  assimilation in the barbarian provinces subject to her influence that she
  had begun while pagan.<a name="NtA2_1"
  href="#Nt2_1"><sup>[1]</sup></a></p>

  <p>In the Orient, however, the churches that are separate from the Greek
  orthodoxy use, even to-day, a variety of dialects calling to mind the
  great diversity of races formerly subject to Rome. In those times twenty
  varieties of speech translated the religious thought of the peoples
  joined under the dominion of the Cæsars. At the beginning of our era
  Hellenism had not yet conquered the uplands of Anatolia,<a name="NtA2_2"
  href="#Nt2_2"><sup>[2]</sup></a> nor central Syria, nor the divisions of
  Egypt. Annexation to the empire might retard and in certain regions
  weaken the power of expansion of Greek civilization, <!-- Page 22
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page22"></a>[22]</span>but it could not
  substitute Latin culture for it<a name="NtA2_3"
  href="#Nt2_3"><sup>[3]</sup></a> except around the camps of the legions
  guarding the frontier, and in a very few colonies. It especially
  benefitted the individuality of each region. The native religions
  retained all their prestige and independence. In their ancient
  sanctuaries that took rank with the richest and most famous of the world,
  a powerful clergy continued to practise ancestral devotions according to
  barbarian rites, and frequently in a barbarian tongue. The traditional
  liturgy, everywhere performed with scrupulous respect, remained Egyptian
  or Semitic, Phrygian or Persian, according to the locality.</p>

  <p>Neither pontifical law nor augural science ever obtained credit
  outside of the Latin world. It is a characteristic fact that the worship
  of the deified emperors, the only official worship required of every one
  by the government as a proof of loyalty, should have originated of its
  own accord in Asia, received its inspiration from the purest monarchic
  traditions, and revived in form and spirit the veneration accorded to the
  Diadochi by their subjects.</p>

  <p>Not only were the gods of Egypt and Asia never supplanted like those
  of Gaul or Spain, but they soon crossed the seas and gained worshipers in
  every Latin province. Isis and Serapis, Cybele and Attis, the Syrian
  Baals, Sabazius and Mithra were honored by brotherhoods of believers as
  far as the remotest limits of Germany. The Oriental reaction that we
  perceive from the beginning of our era, in studying the history of art,
  literature, and philosophy, manifested itself with incomparably greater
  power in the religious sphere. First, there was a slow infiltration of
  despised exotic religions, then, toward the end of the first <!-- Page 23
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page23"></a>[23]</span>century, the
  Orontes, the Nile and the Halys, to use the words of Juvenal, flowed into
  the Tiber, to the great indignation of the old Romans. Finally, a hundred
  years later, an influx of Egyptian, Semitic and Persian beliefs and
  conceptions took place that threatened to submerge all that the Greek and
  Roman genius had laboriously built up. What called forth and permitted
  this spiritual commotion, of which the triumph of Christianity was the
  outcome? Why was the influence of the Orient strongest in the religious
  field? These questions claim our attention. Like all great phenomena of
  history, this particular one was determined by a number of influences
  that concurred in producing it. In the mass of half-known particulars
  that brought it about, certain factors or leading causes, of which every
  one has in turn been considered the most important, may be
  distinguished.</p>

  <p>If we yielded to the tendency of many excellent minds of to-day and
  regarded history as the resultant of economic and social forces, it would
  be easy to show their influence in that great religious movement. The
  industrial and commercial preponderance of the Orient was manifest, for
  there were situated the principal centers of production and export. The
  ever increasing traffic with the Levant induced merchants to establish
  themselves in Italy, in Gaul, in the Danubian countries, in Africa and in
  Spain; in some cities they formed real colonies. The Syrian emigrants
  were especially numerous. Compliant, quick and diligent, they went
  wherever they expected profit, and their colonies, scattered as far as
  the north of Gaul, were centers for the religious propaganda of paganism
  just as the Jewish communities of the Diaspora were for Christian <!--
  Page 24 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page24"></a>[24]</span>preaching. Italy not only bought her grain
  from Egypt, she imported men also; she ordered slaves from Phrygia,
  Cappadocia, Syria and Alexandria to cultivate her depopulated fields and
  perform the domestic duties in her palaces. Who can tell what influence
  chambermaids from Antioch or Memphis gained over the minds of their
  mistresses? At the same time the necessities of war removed officers and
  men from the Euphrates to the Rhine or to the outskirts of the Sahara,
  and everywhere they remained faithful to the gods of their far-away
  country. The requirements of the government transferred functionaries and
  their clerks, the latter frequently of servile birth, into the most
  distant provinces. Finally, the ease of communication, due to the good
  roads, increased the frequency and extent of travel.</p>

  <p>Thus the exchange of products, men and ideas necessarily increased,
  and it might be maintained that theocracy was a necessary consequence of
  the mingling of the races, that the gods of the Orient followed the great
  commercial and social currents, and that their establishment in the
  Occident was a natural result of the movement that drew the excess
  population of the Asiatic cities and rural districts into the less
  thickly inhabited countries.</p>

  <p>These reflections, which could be developed at some length, surely
  show the way in which the Oriental religions spread. It is certain that
  the merchants acted as missionaries in the seaports and places of
  commerce, the soldiers on the frontiers and in the capital, the slaves in
  the city homes,<a name="NtA2_4" href="#Nt2_4"><sup>[4]</sup></a> in the
  rural districts and in public affairs. But while this acquaints us with
  the means and the agents of the diffusion of those religions, <!-- Page
  25 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page25"></a>[25]</span>it tells us
  nothing of the reasons for their adoption by the Romans. We perceive the
  how, but not the why, of their sudden expansion. Especially imperfect is
  our understanding of the reasons for the difference between the Orient
  and the Occident pointed out above.</p>

  <p>An example will make my meaning clear. A Celtic divinity, Epona,<a
  name="NtA2_5" href="#Nt2_5"><sup>[5]</sup></a> was held in particular
  honor as the protectress of horses, as we all know. The Gallic horsemen
  worshiped her wherever they were cantoned; her monuments have been found
  scattered from Scotland to Transylvania. And yet, although this goddess
  enjoyed the same conditions as, for instance Jupiter <i>Dolichenus</i>
  whom the cohorts of Commagene introduced into Europe, it does not appear
  that she ever received the homage of many strangers; it does not appear,
  above all, that druidism ever assumed the shape of "mysteries of Epona"
  into which Greeks and Romans would have asked to be initiated. It was too
  deficient in the intrinsic strength of the Oriental religions, to make
  proselytes.</p>

  <p>Other historians and thinkers of to-day prefer to apply the laws of
  natural science to religious phenomena; and the theories about the
  variation of species find an unforeseen application here. It is
  maintained that the immigration of Orientals, of Syrians in particular,
  was considerable enough to provoke an alteration and rapid deterioration
  in the robust Italic and Celtic races. In addition, a social status
  contrary to nature, and a bad political régime effected the destruction
  of the strongest, the extermination of the best and the ascendancy of the
  worst elements of the population. This multitude, corrupted by
  deleterious cross-breeding and weakened by bad selection, became unable
  to <!-- Page 26 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page26"></a>[26]</span>oppose the invasion of the Asiatic chimeras
  and aberrations. A lowering of the intellectual level and the
  disappearance of the critical spirit accompanied the decline of morals
  and the weakening of character. In the evolution of beliefs the triumph
  of the Orient denoted a regression toward barbarism, a return to the
  remote origins of faith and to the worship of natural forces. This is a
  brief outline of explanations recently proposed and received with some
  favor.<a name="NtA2_6" href="#Nt2_6"><sup>[6]</sup></a></p>

  <p>It cannot be denied that souls and morals appear to have become
  coarser during the Roman decline. Society as a whole was deplorably
  lacking in imagination, intellect and taste. It seemed afflicted with a
  kind of cerebral anemia and incurable sterility. The impaired reason
  accepted the coarsest superstitions, the most extreme asceticism and most
  extravagant theurgy. It resembled an organism incapable of defending
  itself against contagion. All this is partly true; but the theories
  summarized proceed from an incorrect conception of things; in reality
  they are based on the illusion that Asia, under the empire, was inferior
  to Europe. While the triumph of the Oriental religions sometimes assumed
  the appearance of an awakening of savagery, these religions in reality
  represented a more advanced type in the evolution of religious forms than
  the ancient national devotions. They were less primitive, less simple,
  and, if I may use the expression, provided with more organs than the old
  Greco-Roman idolatry. We have indicated this on previous occasions, and
  hope to bring it out with perfect clearness in the course of these
  studies.</p>

  <p>It is hardly necessary to state that a great religious conquest can be
  explained only on moral grounds. <!-- Page 27 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page27"></a>[27]</span>Whatever part must be ascribed to the
  instinct of imitation and the contagion of example, in the last analysis
  we are always face to face with a series of individual conversions. The
  mysterious affinity of minds is as much due to reflection as to the
  continued and almost unconscious influence of confused aspirations that
  produce faith. The obscure gestation of a new ideal is accomplished with
  pangs of anguish. Violent struggles must have disturbed the souls of the
  masses when they were torn away from their old ancestral religions, or
  more often from indifference, by those exacting gods who demanded a
  surrender of the entire person, a <i>devotion</i> in the etymological
  meaning of the word. The consecration to Isis of the hero of Apuleius was
  the result of a call, of an appeal, by the goddess who wanted the
  neophyte to enlist in her sacred militia.<a name="NtA2_7"
  href="#Nt2_7"><sup>[7]</sup></a></p>

  <p>If it is true that every conversion involves a psychological crisis, a
  transformation of the intimate personality of the individual, this is
  especially true of the propagation of the Oriental religions. Born
  outside of the narrow limits of the Roman city, they grew up frequently
  in hostility to it, and were international, consequently individual. The
  bond that formerly kept devotion centered upon the city or the tribe,
  upon the <i>gens</i> or the family, was broken. In place of the ancient
  social groups communities of initiates came into existence, who
  considered themselves brothers no matter where they came from.<a
  name="NtA2_8" href="#Nt2_8"><sup>[8]</sup></a> A god, conceived of as
  being universal, received every mortal as his child. Whenever these
  religions had any relation to the state they were no longer called upon
  to support old municipal or social institutions, but to lend their
  strength to the <!-- Page 28 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page28"></a>[28]</span>authority of a sovereign regarded as the
  eternal lord of the whole world jointly with God himself. In the circles
  of the mystics, Asiatics mingled with Romans, and slaves with high
  functionaries. The adoption of the same faith made the poor freedman the
  equal and sometimes the superior, of the decurion and the
  <i>clarissimus</i>. All submitted to the same rules and participated in
  the same festivities, in which the distinctions of an aristocratic
  society and the differences of blood and country were obliterated. The
  distinctions of race and nationality, of magistrate and father of a
  family, of patrician and plebeian, of citizen and foreigner, were
  abolished; all were but men, and in order to recruit members, those
  religions worked upon man and his character.</p>

  <p>In order to gain the masses and the cream of Roman society (as they
  did for a whole century) the barbarian mysteries had to possess a
  powerful charm, they had to satisfy the deep wants of the human soul, and
  their strength had to be superior to that of the ancient Greco-Roman
  religion. To explain the reasons for their victory we must try to reveal
  the nature of this superiority&mdash;I mean their superiority in the
  struggle, without assuming innate superiority.</p>

  <p>I believe that we can define it by stating that those religions gave
  greater satisfaction first, to the senses and passions, secondly, to the
  intelligence, finally, and above all, to the conscience.</p>

  <p>In the first place, they appealed more strongly to the senses. This
  was their most obvious feature, and it has been pointed out more often
  than any other. Perhaps there never was a religion so cold and prosaic as
  the Roman. Being subordinated to politics, it sought, <!-- Page 29
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page29"></a>[29]</span>above all, to
  secure the protection of the gods for the state and to avert the effects
  of their malevolence by the strict execution of appropriate practices. It
  entered into a contract with the celestial powers from which mutual
  obligations arose: sacrifices on one side, favors on the other. The
  pontiffs, who were also magistrates, regulated the religious practices
  with the exact precision of jurists;<a name="NtA2_9"
  href="#Nt2_9"><sup>[9]</sup></a> as far as we know the prayers were all
  couched in formulas as dry and verbose as notarial instruments. The
  liturgy reminds one of the ancient civil law on account of the minuteness
  of its prescriptions. This religion looked suspiciously at the
  abandonment of the soul to the ecstasies of devotion. It repressed, by
  force if necessary, the exuberant manifestations of too ardent faith and
  everything that was not in keeping with the grave dignity befitting the
  relations of a <i>civis Romanus</i> with a god. The Jews had the same
  scrupulous respect as the Romans for a religious code and formulas of the
  past, "but in spite of their dry and minute practices, the legalism of
  the Pharisees stirred the heart more strongly than did Roman
  formalism."<a name="NtA2_10" href="#Nt2_10"><sup>[10]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Lacking the recognized authority of official creeds, the Oriental
  religions had to appeal to the passions of the individual in order to
  make proselytes. They attracted men first by the disturbing seductiveness
  of their mysteries, where terror and hope were evoked in turns, and
  charmed them by the pomp of their festivities and the magnificence of
  their processions. Men were fascinated by the languishing songs and
  intoxicating melodies. Above all these religions taught men how to reach
  that blissful state in which the soul was freed from the tyranny of the
  body and of suffering, <!-- Page 30 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page30"></a>[30]</span>and lost itself in raptures. They led to
  ecstasy either by means of nervous tension resulting from continued
  maceration and fervent contemplation or by more material means like the
  stimulation of vertiginous dances and dizzy music, or even by the
  absorption of fermented liquors after a long abstinence,<a name="NtA2_11"
  href="#Nt2_11"><sup>[11]</sup></a> as in the case of the priests of the
  Great Mother. In mysticism it is easy to descend from the sublime to the
  vile.</p>

  <p>Even the gods, with whom the believers thought they were uniting
  themselves in their mystic outbursts, were more human and sometimes more
  sensual than those of the Occident. The latter had that quietude of soul
  in which the philosophic morality of the Greeks saw a privilege of the
  sage; in the serenity of Olympus they enjoyed perpetual youth; they were
  Immortals. The divinities of the Orient, on the contrary, suffered and
  died, but only to revive again.<a name="NtA2_12"
  href="#Nt2_12"><sup>[12]</sup></a> Osiris, Attis and Adonis were mourned
  like mortals by wife or mistress, Isis, Cybele or Astarte. With them the
  mystics moaned for their deceased god and later, after he had revived,
  celebrated with exultation his birth to a new life. Or else they joined
  in the passion of Mithra, condemned to create the world in suffering.
  This common grief and joy were often expressed with savage violence, by
  bloody mutilations, long wails of despair, and extravagant acclamations.
  The manifestations of the extreme fanaticism of those barbarian races
  that had not been touched by Greek skepticism and the very ardor of their
  faith inflamed the souls of the multitudes attracted by the exotic
  gods.</p>

  <p>The Oriental religions touched every chord of sensibility and
  satisfied the thirst for religious emotion that the austere Roman creed
  had been unable to quench. <!-- Page 31 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page31"></a>[31]</span>But at the same time they satisfied the
  intellect more fully, and this is my second point.</p>

  <p>In very early times Greece&mdash;later imitated by Rome&mdash;became
  resolutely rationalistic: her greatest originality lies here. Her
  philosophy was purely laical; thought was unrestrained by any sacred
  tradition; it even pretended to pass judgment upon these traditions and
  condemned or approved of them. Being sometimes hostile, sometimes
  indifferent and some times conciliatory, it always remained independent
  of faith. But while Greece thus freed herself from the fetters of a
  superannuated mythology, and openly and boldly constructed those systems
  of metaphysics by means of which she claimed to solve the enigmas of the
  universe, her religion lost its vitality and dried up because it lacked
  the strengthening nourishment of reflection. It became a thing devoid of
  sense, whose <i>raison d'être</i> was no longer understood; it embodied
  dead ideas and an obsolete conception of the world. In Greece as well as
  at Rome it was reduced to a collection of unintelligible rites,
  scrupulously and mechanically reproduced without addition or omission
  because they had been practised by the ancestors of long ago, and
  formulas hallowed by the <i>mos maiorum</i>, that were no longer
  understood or sincerely cherished. Never did a people of advanced culture
  have a more infantile religion.</p>

  <p>The Oriental civilizations on the contrary were sacerdotal in
  character. As in medieval Europe, the scholars of Asia and Egypt were
  priests. In the temples the nature of the gods and of man were not the
  only subjects of discussion; mathematics, astronomy, medicine, philology
  and history were also studied. The successors of Berosus, a priest from
  Babylonia, and <!-- Page 32 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page32"></a>[32]</span>Manetho, a priest from Heliopolis, were
  considered deeply versed in all intellectual disciplines as late as the
  time of Strabo.<a name="NtA2_13" href="#Nt2_13"><sup>[13]</sup></a></p>

  <p>This state of affairs proved detrimental to the progress of science.
  Researches were conducted according to preconceived ideas and were
  perverted through strange prejudices. Astrology and magic were the
  monstrous fruit of a hybrid union. But all this certainly gave religion a
  power it had never possessed either in Greece or Rome.</p>

  <p>All results of observation, all conquests of thought, were used by an
  erudite clergy to attain the principal object of their activities, the
  solution of the problem of the destiny of man and matter, and of the
  relations of heaven and earth. An ever enlarging conception of the
  universe kept transforming the modes of belief. Faith presumed to enslave
  both physics and metaphysics. The credit of every discovery was given to
  the gods. Thoth in Egypt and Bel in Chaldea were the revealers not only
  of theology and the ritual, but of all human knowledge.<a name="NtA2_14"
  href="#Nt2_14"><sup>[14]</sup></a> The names of the Oriental Hipparchi
  and Euclids who solved the first problems of astronomy and geometry were
  unknown; but a confused and grotesque literature made use of the name and
  authority of Hermes Trismegistus. The doctrines of the planetary spheres
  and the opposition of the four elements were made to support systems of
  anthropology and of morality; the theorems of astronomy were used to
  establish an alleged method of divination; formulas of incantation,
  supposed to subject divine powers to the magician, were combined with
  chemical experiments and medical prescriptions.</p>

  <p>This intimate union of erudition and faith continued <!-- Page 33
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page33"></a>[33]</span>in the Latin
  world. Theology became more and more a process of deification of the
  principles or agents discovered by science and a worship of time regarded
  as the first cause, the stars whose course determined the events of this
  world, the four elements whose innumerable combinations produced the
  natural phenomena, and especially the sun which preserved heat, fertility
  and life. The dogmas of the mysteries of Mithra were, to a certain
  extent, the religious expression of Roman physics and astronomy. In all
  forms of pantheism the knowledge of nature appears to be inseparable from
  that of God.<a name="NtA2_15" href="#Nt2_15"><sup>[15]</sup></a> Art
  itself complied more and more with the tendency to express erudite ideas
  by subtle symbolism, and it represented in allegorical figures the
  relations of divine powers and cosmic forces, like the sky, the earth,
  the ocean, the planets, the constellations and the winds. The sculptors
  engraved on stone everything man thought and taught. In a general way the
  belief prevailed that redemption and salvation depended on the revelation
  of certain truths, on a knowledge of the gods, of the world and of our
  person, and piety became gnosis.<a name="NtA2_16"
  href="#Nt2_16"><sup>[16]</sup></a></p>

  <p>But, you will say, since in the classic age philosophy also claimed to
  lead to morality through instruction and to acquaint man with the supreme
  good, why did it yield to Oriental religions that were in reality neither
  original nor innovating? Quite right, and if a powerful rationalist
  school, possessed of a good critical method, had led the minds, we may
  believe that it would have checked the invasion of the barbarian
  mysteries or at least limited their field of action. However, as has
  frequently been pointed out, even in ancient Greece the philosophic
  critics had very little hold on <!-- Page 34 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page34"></a>[34]</span>popular religion obstinately faithful to its
  inherited superstitious forms. But how many second century minds shared
  Lucian's skepticism in regard to the dogmatic systems! The various sects
  were fighting each other for ever so long without convincing one another
  of their alleged error. The satirist of Samosata enjoyed opposing their
  exclusive pretensions while he himself reclined on the "soft pillow of
  doubt." But only intelligent minds could delight in doubt or surrender to
  it; the masses wanted certainties. There was nothing to revive confidence
  in the power of a decrepit and threadbare science. No great discovery
  transformed the conception of the universe. Nature no longer betrayed her
  secrets, the earth remained unexplored and the past inscrutable. Every
  branch of knowledge was forgotten. The world cursed with sterility, could
  but repeat itself; it had the poignant appreciation of its own decay and
  impotence. Tired of fruitless researches, the mind surrendered to the
  necessity of believing. Since the intellect was unable to formulate a
  consistent rule of life faith alone could supply it, and the multitudes
  gravitated toward the temples, where the truths taught to man in earlier
  days by the Oriental gods were revealed. The stanch adherence of past
  generations to beliefs and rites of unlimited antiquity seemed to
  guarantee their truth and efficacy. This current was so strong that
  philosophy itself was swept toward mysticism and the neo-Platonist school
  became a theurgy.</p>

  <p>The Oriental mysteries, then, could stir the soul by arousing
  admiration and terror, pity and enthusiasm in turn. They gave the
  intellect the illusion of learned depth and absolute certainty and
  finally&mdash;our third <!-- Page 35 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page35"></a>[35]</span>point&mdash;they satisfied conscience as
  well as passion and reason. Among the complex causes that guaranteed
  their domination, this was without doubt the most effective.</p>

  <p>In every period of their history the Romans, unlike the Greeks in this
  respect, judged theories and institutions especially by their practical
  results. They always had a soldier's and business man's contempt for
  metaphysicians. It is a matter of frequent observation that the
  philosophy of the Latin world neglected metaphysical speculations and
  concentrated its attention on morals, just as later the Roman church left
  to the subtle Hellenes the interminable controversies over the essence of
  the divine logos and the double nature of Christ. Questions that could
  rouse and divide her were those having a direct application to life, like
  the doctrine of grace.</p>

  <p>The old religion of the Romans had to respond to this demand of their
  genius. Its poverty was honest.<a name="NtA2_17"
  href="#Nt2_17"><sup>[17]</sup></a> Its mythology did not possess the
  poetic charm of that of Greece, nor did its gods have the imperishable
  beauty of the Olympians, but they were more moral, or at least pretended
  to be. A large number were simply personified qualities, like chastity
  and piety. With the aid of the censors they imposed the practice of the
  national virtues, that is to say of the qualities useful to society,
  temperance, courage, chastity, obedience to parents and magistrates,
  reverence for the oath and the law, in fact, the practice of every form
  of patriotism. During the last century of the republic the pontiff
  Scaevola, one of the foremost men of his time, rejected as futile the
  divinities of fable and poetry, as superfluous or obnoxious those of the
  philosophers and the exegetists, <!-- Page 36 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page36"></a>[36]</span>and reserved all his favors for those of the
  statesmen, as the only ones fit for the people.<a name="NtA2_18"
  href="#Nt2_18"><sup>[18]</sup></a> These were the ones protecting the old
  customs, traditions and frequently even the old privileges. But in the
  perpetual flux of things conservatism ever carries with it a germ of
  death. Just as the law failed to maintain the integrity of ancient
  principles, like the absolute power of the father of the family,
  principles that were no longer in keeping with the social realities, so
  religion witnessed the foundering of a system of ethics contrary to the
  moral code that had slowly been established. The idea of collective
  responsibility contained in a number of beliefs is one instance. If a
  vestal violated her vow of chastity the divinity sent a pest that ceased
  only on the day the culprit was punished. Sometimes the angry heavens
  granted victory to the army only on condition that a general or soldier
  dedicate himself to the infernal gods as an expiatory victim. However,
  through the influence of the philosophers and the jurists the conviction
  slowly gained ground that each one was responsible for his own misdeeds,
  and that it was not equitable to make a whole city suffer for the crime
  of an individual. People ceased to admit that the gods crushed the good
  as well as the wicked in one punishment. Often, also, the divine anger
  was thought to be as ridiculous in its manifestations as in its cause.
  The rural superstitions of the country districts of Latium continued to
  live in the pontifical code of the Roman people. If a lamb with two heads
  or a colt with five legs was born, solemn supplications were prescribed
  to avert the misfortunes foreboded by those terrifying prodigies.<a
  name="NtA2_19" href="#Nt2_19"><sup>[19]</sup></a></p>

  <p>All these puerile and monstrous beliefs that burdened <!-- Page 37
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page37"></a>[37]</span>the religion of
  the Latins had thrown it into disrepute. Its morality no longer responded
  to the new conception of justice beginning to prevail. As a rule Rome
  remedied the poverty of her theology and ritual by taking what she needed
  from the Greeks. But here this resource failed her because the poetic,
  artistic and even intellectual religion of the Greeks was hardly moral.
  And the fables of a mythology jeered at by the philosophers, parodied on
  the stage and put to verse by libertine poets were anything but
  edifying.</p>

  <p>Moreover&mdash;this was its second weakness&mdash;whatever morality it
  demanded of a pious man went unrewarded. People no longer believed that
  the gods continually intervened in the affairs of men to reveal hidden
  crimes and to punish triumphant vice, or that Jupiter would hurl his
  thunderbolt to crush the perjurer. At the time of the proscriptions and
  the civil wars under Nero or Commodus it was more than plain that power
  and possessions were for the strongest, the ablest or even the luckiest,
  and not for the wisest or the most pious. The idea of reward or
  punishment beyond the grave found little credit. The notions of future
  life were hazy, uncertain, doubtful and contradictory. Everybody knows
  Juvenal's famous lines: "That there are manes, a subterranean kingdom, a
  ferryman with a long pole, and black frogs in the whirlpools of the Styx;
  that so many thousand men could cross the waves in a single boat, to-day
  even children refuse to believe."<a name="NtA2_20"
  href="#Nt2_20"><sup>[20]</sup></a></p>

  <p>After the fall of the republic indifference spread, the temples were
  abandoned and threatened to tumble into ruins, the clergy found it
  difficult to recruit members, the festivities, once so popular, fell into
  desuetude, and <!-- Page 38 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page38"></a>[38]</span>Varro, at the beginning of his
  <i>Antiquities</i>, expressed his fear lest "the gods might perish, not
  from the blows of foreign enemies, but from very neglect on the part of
  the citizens."<a name="NtA2_21" href="#Nt2_21"><sup>[21]</sup></a> It is
  well known that Augustus, prompted by political rather than by religious
  reasons, attempted to revive the dying religion. His religious reforms
  stood in close relation to his moral legislation and the establishment of
  the imperial dignity. Their tendency was to bring the people back to the
  pious practice of ancient virtues but also to chain them to the new
  political order. The alliance of throne and altar in Europe dates from
  that time.</p>

  <p>This attempted reform failed entirely. Making religion an auxiliary to
  moral policing is not a means of establishing its empire over souls.
  Formal reverence for the official gods is not incompatible with absolute
  and practical skepticism. The restoration attempted by Augustus is
  nevertheless very characteristic because it is so consistent with the
  Roman spirit which by temperament and tradition demanded that religion
  should support morality and the state.</p>

  <p>The Asiatic religions fulfilled the requirements. The change of
  régime, although unwelcome, brought about a change of religion. The
  increasing tendency of Cæsarism toward absolute monarchy made it lean
  more and more upon the Oriental clergy. True to the traditions of the
  Achemenides and the Pharaohs, those priests preached doctrines tending to
  elevate the sovereign above humanity, and they supplied the emperors with
  dogmatic justification for their despotism.<a name="NtA2_22"
  href="#Nt2_22"><sup>[22]</sup></a></p>

  <p>It is a noteworthy fact that the rulers who most loudly proclaimed
  their autocratic pretentions, like <!-- Page 39 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page39"></a>[39]</span>Domitian and Commodus,
  were also those that favored foreign creeds most openly.</p>

  <p>But his selfish support merely sanctioned a power already established.
  The propaganda of the Oriental religions was originally democratic and
  sometimes even revolutionary like the Isis worship. Step by step they
  advanced, always reaching higher social classes and appealing to popular
  conscience rather than to the zeal of functionaries.</p>

  <p>As a matter of fact all these religions, except that of Mithra, seem
  at first sight to be far less austere than the Roman creed. We shall have
  occasion to note that they contained coarse and immodest fables and
  atrocious or vile rites. The Egyptian gods were expelled from Rome by
  Augustus and Tiberius on the charge of being immoral, but they were
  called immoral principally because they opposed a certain conception of
  the social order. They gave little attention to the public interest but
  attached considerable importance to the inner life and consequently to
  the value of the individual. Two new things, in particular, were brought
  to Italy by the Oriental priests: mysterious methods of purification, by
  which they claimed to wash away the impurities of the soul, and the
  assurance that a blessed immortality would be the reward of piety.<a
  name="NtA2_23" href="#Nt2_23"><sup>[23]</sup></a></p>

  <p>These religions pretended to restore lost purity<a name="NtA2_24"
  href="#Nt2_24"><sup>[24]</sup></a> to the soul either through the
  performance of ritual ceremonies or through mortifications and penance.
  They had a series of ablutions and lustrations supposed to restore
  original innocence to the mystic. He had to wash himself in the sacred
  water according to certain prescribed forms. This was really a magic
  rite, because bodily purity acted sympathetically upon the soul, or <!--
  Page 40 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page40"></a>[40]</span>else it
  was a real spiritual disinfection with the water driving out the evil
  spirits that had caused pollution. The votary, again, might drink or
  besprinkle himself with the blood of a slaughtered victim or of the
  priests themselves, in which case the prevailing idea was that the liquid
  circulating in the veins was a vivifying principle capable of imparting a
  new existence.<a name="NtA2_25" href="#Nt2_25"><sup>[25]</sup></a> These
  and similar rites<a name="NtA2_26" href="#Nt2_26"><sup>[26]</sup></a>
  used in the mysteries were supposed to regenerate the <span
  class="correction" title="text reads `initated'">initiated</span> person
  and to restore him to an immaculate and incorruptible life.<a
  name="NtA2_27" href="#Nt2_27"><sup>[27]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Purgation of the soul was not effected solely by liturgic acts but
  also by self-denial and suffering.<a name="NtA2_28"
  href="#Nt2_28"><sup>[28]</sup></a> The meaning of the term
  <i>expiatio</i> changed. Expiation, or atonement, was no longer
  accomplished by the exact performance of certain ceremonies pleasing to
  the gods and required by a sacred code like a penalty for damages, but by
  privation and personal suffering. Abstinence, which prevented the
  introduction of deadly elements into the system, and chastity, which
  preserved man from pollution and debility, became means of getting rid of
  the domination of the evil powers and of regaining heavenly favor.<a
  name="NtA2_29" href="#Nt2_29"><sup>[29]</sup></a> Macerations, laborious
  pilgrimages, public confessions, sometimes flagellations and mutilations,
  in fact all forms of penance and mortifications uplifted the fallen man
  and brought him nearer to the gods. In Phrygia a sinner would write his
  sin and the punishment he suffered upon a stela for every one to see and
  would return thanks to heaven that his prayer of repentance had been
  heard.<a name="NtA2_30" href="#Nt2_30"><sup>[30]</sup></a> The Syrian,
  who had offended his goddess by eating her sacred fish, dressed in sordid
  rags, covered himself with a sack and sat in the public highway humbly to
  proclaim his misdeed in order to obtain forgiveness.<a name="NtA2_31"
  href="#Nt2_31"><sup>[31]</sup></a> <!-- Page 41 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page41"></a>[41]</span>"Three times, in the
  depths of winter," says Juvenal, "the devotee of Isis will dive into the
  chilly waters of the Tiber, and shivering with cold, will drag herself
  around the temple upon her bleeding knees; if the goddess commands, she
  will go to the outskirts of Egypt to take water from the Nile and empty
  it within the sanctuary."<a name="NtA2_32"
  href="#Nt2_32"><sup>[32]</sup></a> This shows the introduction into
  Europe of Oriental asceticism.</p>

  <p>But there were impious acts and impure passions that contaminated and
  defiled the soul. Since this infection could be destroyed only by
  expiations prescribed by the gods, the extent of the sin and the
  character of the necessary penance had to be estimated. It was the
  priest's prerogative to judge the misdeeds and to impose the penalties.
  This circumstance gave the clergy a very different character from the one
  it had at Rome. The priest was no longer simply the guardian of sacred
  traditions, the intermediary between man or the state and the gods, but
  also a spiritual guide. He taught his flock the long series of
  obligations and restrictions for shielding their weakness from the
  attacks of evil spirits. He knew how to quiet remorse and scruples, and
  to restore the sinner to spiritual calm. Being versed in sacred
  knowledge, he had the power of reconciling the gods. Frequent sacred
  repasts maintained a spirit of fellowship among the mystics of Cybele,
  Mithra or the Baals,<a name="NtA2_33" href="#Nt2_33"><sup>[33]</sup></a>
  and a daily service unceasingly revived the faith of the Isis worshipers.
  In consequence, the clergy were entirely absorbed in their holy office
  and lived only for and by their temples. Unlike the sacerdotal colleges
  of Rome in which the secular and religious functions were not yet clearly
  differentiated,<a name="NtA2_34" href="#Nt2_34"><sup>[34]</sup></a> they
  were not an <!-- Page 42 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page42"></a>[42]</span>administrative commission ruling the sacred
  affairs of the state under the supervision of the senate; they formed
  what might almost be called a caste of recluses distinguished from
  ordinary men by their insignia, garb, habits and food, and constituting
  an independent body with a hierarchy, formulary and even councils of
  their own.<a name="NtA2_35" href="#Nt2_35"><sup>[35]</sup></a> They did
  not return to every-day duties as private citizens or to the direction of
  public affairs as magistrates as the ancient pontiffs had done after the
  solemn festival service.</p>

  <p>We can readily understand that these beliefs and institutions were
  bound to establish the Oriental religions and their priests on a strong
  basis. Their influence must have been especially powerful at the time of
  the Cæsars. The laxity of morals at the beginning of our era has been
  exaggerated but it was real. Many unhealthy symptoms told of a profound
  moral anarchy weighing on a weakened and irresolute society. The farther
  we go toward the end of the empire the more its energy seems to fail and
  the character of men to weaken. The number of strong healthy minds
  incapable of a lasting aberration and without need of guidance or comfort
  was growing ever smaller. We note the spread of that feeling of
  exhaustion and debility which follows the aberrations of passion, and the
  same weakness that led to crime impelled men to seek absolution in the
  formal practices of asceticism. They applied to the Oriental priests for
  spiritual remedies.</p>

  <p>People flattered themselves that by performing the rites they would
  attain a condition of felicity after death. All barbarian mysteries
  pretended to reveal to their adherents the secret of blessed immortality.
  Participation in the occult ceremonies of the sect was a <!-- Page 43
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page43"></a>[43]</span>chief means of
  salvation.<a name="NtA2_36" href="#Nt2_36"><sup>[36]</sup></a> The vague
  and disheartening beliefs of ancient paganism in regard to life after
  death were transformed into the firm hope of a well-defined form of
  happiness.<a name="NtA2_37" href="#Nt2_37"><sup>[37]</sup></a></p>

  <p>This faith in a personal survival of the soul and even of the body was
  based upon a strong instinct of human nature, the instinct of
  self-preservation. Social and moral conditions in the empire during its
  decline gave it greater strength than it had ever possessed before.<a
  name="NtA2_38" href="#Nt2_38"><sup>[38]</sup></a> The third century saw
  so much suffering, anguish and violence, so much unnecessary ruin and so
  many unpunished crimes, that the Roman world took refuge in the
  expectation of a better existence in which all the iniquity of this world
  would be retrieved. No earthly hope brightened life. The tyranny of a
  corrupt bureaucracy choked all disposition for political progress.
  Science stagnated and revealed no more unknown truths. Growing poverty
  discouraged the spirit of enterprise. The idea gained ground that
  humanity was afflicted with incurable decay, that nature was approaching
  her doom and that the end of world was near.<a name="NtA2_39"
  href="#Nt2_39"><sup>[39]</sup></a> We must remember all these causes of
  discouragement and despondency to understand the power of the idea,
  expressed so frequently, that the spirit animating man was forced by
  bitter necessity to imprison itself in matter and that it was delivered
  from its carnal captivity by death. In the heavy atmosphere of a period
  of oppression and impotence the dejected soul longed with incredible
  ardor to fly to the radiant abode of heaven.</p>

  <p>To recapitulate, the Oriental religions acted upon the senses, the
  intellect and the conscience at the same time, and therefore gained a
  hold on the entire man. <!-- Page 44 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page44"></a>[44]</span>Compared with the ancient creeds, they
  appear to have offered greater beauty of ritual, greater truth of
  doctrine and a far superior morality. The imposing ceremonial of their
  festivities and the alternating pomp and sensuality, gloom and exaltation
  of their services appealed especially to the simple and the humble, while
  the progressive revelation of ancient wisdom, inherited from the old and
  distant Orient, captivated the cultured mind. The emotions excited by
  these religions and the consolations offered strongly attracted the
  women, who were the most fervent and generous followers and most
  passionate propagandists<a name="NtA2_40"
  href="#Nt2_40"><sup>[40]</sup></a> of the religions of Isis and Cybele.
  Mithra was worshiped almost exclusively by men, whom he subjected to a
  rigid moral discipline. Thus souls were gained by the promise of
  spiritual purification and the prospect of eternal happiness.</p>

  <p>The worship of the Roman gods was a civic duty, the worship of the
  foreign gods the expression of a personal belief. The latter were the
  objects of the thoughts, feelings and intimate aspirations of the
  individual, not merely of the traditional and, one might say, functional
  adoration of the citizen. The ancient municipal devotions were connected
  with a number of earthly interests that helped to support each other.
  They were one of various forms of family spirit and patriotism and
  guaranteed the prosperity of the community. The Oriental mysteries,
  directing the will toward an ideal goal and exalting the inner spirit,
  were less mindful of economic utility, but they could produce that
  vibration of the moral being that caused emotions, stronger than any
  rational faculty, to gush forth from the depths of the soul. Through a
  sudden illumination <!-- Page 45 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page45"></a>[45]</span>they furnished the intuition of a spiritual
  life whose intensity made all material happiness appear insipid and
  contemptible. This stirring appeal of supernatural life made the
  propaganda irresistible. The same ardent enthusiasm guaranteed at the
  same time the uncontested domination of neo-Platonism among the
  philosophers. Antiquity expired and a new era was born.</p>

<h3>ASIA MINOR.</h3>

  <p>The first Oriental religion adopted by the Romans was that of the
  goddess of Phrygia, whom the people of Pessinus and Mount Ida worshiped,
  and who received the name of <i>Magna Mater deum Idea</i> in the
  Occident. Its history in Italy covers six centuries, and we can trace
  each phase of the transformation that changed it in the course of time
  from a collection of very primitive nature beliefs into a system of
  spiritualized mysteries used by some as a weapon against Christianity. We
  shall now endeavor to outline the successive phases of that slow
  metamorphosis.</p>

  <p>This religion is the only one whose success in the Latin world was
  caused originally by a mere chance circumstance. In 205 B. C, when
  Hannibal, vanquished but still threatening, made his last stand in the
  mountains of Bruttium, repeated torrents of stones frightened the Roman
  people. When the books were officially consulted in regard to this
  prodigy they promised that the enemy would be driven from Italy if the
  Great Mother of Ida could be brought to Rome. Nobody but the Sibyls
  themselves had the power of averting the evils prophesied by them. They
  had come to Italy from Asia Minor, and in this critical situation their
  sacred poem recommended the practice of their native religion as a
  remedy. In token of his <!-- Page 47 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page47"></a>[47]</span>friendship, King Attalus presented the
  ambassadors of the senate with the black aerolite, supposed to be the
  abode of the goddess, that this ruler had shortly before transferred from
  Pessinus to Pergamum. According to the mandate of the oracle the stone
  was received at Ostia by the best citizen of the land, an honor accorded
  to Scipio Nasica&mdash;and carried by the most esteemed matrons to the
  Palatine, where, hailed by the cheers of the multitude and surrounded by
  fumes of incense, it was solemnly installed (Nones of April, 204). This
  triumphal entry was later glorified by marvelous legends, and the poets
  told of edifying miracles that had occurred during Cybele's voyage. In
  the same year Scipio transferred the seat of war to Africa, and Hannibal,
  compelled to meet him there, was beaten at Zama. The prediction of the
  Sybils had come true and Rome was rid of the long Punic terror. The
  foreign goddess was honored in recognition of the service she had
  rendered. A temple was erected to her on the summit of the Palatine, and
  every year a celebration enhanced by scenic plays, the <i>ludi
  Megalenses</i>, commemorated the date of dedication of the sanctuary and
  the arrival of the goddess (April 4th-10th).</p>

  <p>What was this Asiatic religion that had suddenly been transferred into
  the heart of Rome by an extraordinary circumstance? Even then it could
  look back upon a long period of development. It combined beliefs of
  various origin. It contained primitive usages of the religion of
  Anatolia, some of which have survived to this day in spite of
  Christianity and Islam. Like the Kizil-Bash peasants of to-day, the
  ancient inhabitants of the peninsula met on the summits of mountains
  covered with woods no ax had desecrated, and <!-- Page 48 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page48"></a>[48]</span>celebrated their festal
  days.<a name="NtA3_1" href="#Nt3_1"><sup>[1]</sup></a> They believed that
  Cybele resided on the high summits of Ida and Berecyntus, and the
  perennial pines, in conjunction with the prolific and early maturing
  almond tree, were the sacred trees of Attis. Besides trees, the country
  people worshiped stones, rocks or meteors that had fallen from the sky
  like the one taken from Pessinus to Pergamum and thence to Rome. They
  also venerated certain animals, especially the most powerful of them all,
  the lion, who may at one time have been the totem of savage tribes.<a
  name="NtA3_2" href="#Nt3_2"><sup>[2]</sup></a> In mythology as well as in
  art the lion remained the riding or driving animal of the Great Mother.
  Their conception of the divinity was indistinct and impersonal. A goddess
  of the earth, called Mâ or Cybele, was revered as the fecund mother of
  all things, the "mistress of the wild beasts"<a name="NtA3_3"
  href="#Nt3_3"><sup>[3]</sup></a> that inhabit the woods. A god Attis, or
  Papas, was regarded as her husband, but the first place in this divine
  household belonged to the woman, a reminiscence of the period of
  matriarchy.<a name="NtA3_4" href="#Nt3_4"><sup>[4]</sup></a></p>

  <p>When the Phrygians at a very early period came from Thrace and
  inserted themselves like a wedge in the old Anatolian races, they adopted
  the vague deities of their new country by identifying them with their
  own, after the habit of pagan nations. Thus Attis became one with the
  Dionysus-Sabazius of the conquerors, or at least assumed some of his
  characteristics. This Thracian Dionysus was a god of vegetation. Foucart
  has thus admirably pictured his savage nature: "Wooded summits, deep oak
  and pine forests, ivy-clad caverns were at all times his favorite haunts.
  Mortals who were anxious to know the powerful divinity ruling these
  solitudes had to observe the life of his kingdom, <!-- Page 49 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page49"></a>[49]</span>and to guess the god's
  nature from the phenomena through which he manifested his power. Seeing
  the creeks descend in noisy foaming cascades, or hearing the roaring of
  steers in the uplands and the strange sounds of the wind-beaten forests,
  the Thracians thought they heard the voice and the calls of the lord of
  that empire, and imagined a god who was fond of extravagant leaps and of
  wild roaming over the wooded mountains. This conception inspired their
  religion, for the surest way for mortals to ingratiate themselves with a
  divinity was to imitate him, and as far as possible to make their lives
  resemble his. For this reason the Thracians endeavored to attain the
  divine delirium that transported their Dionysus, and hoped to realize
  their purpose by following their invisible yet ever-present lord in his
  chase over the mountains."<a name="NtA3_5"
  href="#Nt3_5"><sup>[5]</sup></a></p>

  <p>In the Phrygian religion we find the same beliefs and rites, scarcely
  modified at all, with the one difference that Attis, the god of
  vegetation, was united to the goddess of the earth instead of living "in
  sullen loneliness." When the tempest was beating the forests of the
  Berecyntus or Ida, it was Cybele traveling about in her car drawn by
  roaring lions mourning her lover's death. A crowd of worshipers followed
  her through woods and thickets, mingling their shouts with the shrill
  sound of flutes, with the dull beat of tambourines, with the rattling of
  castanets and the dissonance of brass cymbals. Intoxicated with shouting
  and with uproar of the instruments, excited by their impetuous advance,
  breathless and panting, they surrendered to the raptures of a sacred
  enthusiasm. Catullus has left us a dramatic description of this divine
  ecstasy.<a name="NtA3_6" href="#Nt3_6"><sup>[6]</sup></a> <!-- Page 50
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page50"></a>[50]</span></p>

  <p>The religion of Phrygia was perhaps even more violent than that of
  Thrace. The climate of the Anatolian uplands is one of extremes. Its
  winters are rough, long and cold, the spring rains suddenly develop a
  vigorous vegetation that is scorched by the hot summer sun. The abrupt
  contrasts of a nature generous and sterile, radiant and bleak in turn,
  caused excesses of sadness and joy that were unknown in temperate and
  smiling regions, where the ground was never buried under snow nor
  scorched by the sun. The Phrygians mourned the long agony and death of
  the vegetation, but when the verdure reappeared in March they surrendered
  to the excitement of a tumultuous joy. In Asia savage rites that had been
  unknown in Thrace or practiced in milder form expressed the vehemence of
  those opposing feelings. In the midst of their orgies, and after wild
  dances, some of the worshipers voluntarily wounded themselves and,
  becoming intoxicated with the view of the blood, with which they
  besprinkled their altars, they believed they were uniting themselves with
  their divinity. Or else, arriving at a paroxysm of frenzy, they
  sacrificed their virility to the gods as certain Russian dissenters still
  do to-day. These men became priests of Cybele and were called Galli.
  Violent ecstasis was always an endemic disease in Phrygia. As late as the
  Antonines, montanist prophets that arose in that country attempted to
  introduce it into Christianity.</p>

  <p>All these excessive and degrading demonstrations of an extreme worship
  must not cause us to slight the power of the feeling that inspired it.
  The sacred ecstasy, the voluntary mutilations and the eagerly sought
  sufferings manifested an ardent longing for <!-- Page 51 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page51"></a>[51]</span>deliverance from
  subjection to carnal instincts, and a fervent desire to free the soul
  from the bonds of matter. The ascetic tendencies went so far as to create
  a kind of begging monachism&mdash;the <i>métragyrtes</i>. They also
  harmonized with some of the ideas of renunciation taught by Greek
  philosophy, and at an early period Hellenic theologians took an interest
  in this devotion that attracted and repelled them at the same time.
  Timotheus the Eumolpid, who was one of the founders of the Alexandrian
  religion of Serapis, derived the inspiration for his essays on religious
  reform, among other sources, from the ancient Phrygian myths. Those
  thinkers undoubtedly succeeded in making the priests of Pessinus
  themselves admit many speculations quite foreign to the old Anatolian
  nature worship. The votaries of Cybele began at a very remote period to
  practise "mysteries"<a name="NtA3_7" href="#Nt3_7"><sup>[7]</sup></a> in
  which the initiates were made acquainted, by degrees, with a wisdom that
  was always considered divine, but underwent peculiar variations in the
  course of time.</p>

<hr class="short" >

  <p>Such is the religion which the rough Romans of the Punic wars accepted
  and adopted. Hidden under theological and cosmological doctrines it
  contained an ancient stock of very primitive and coarse religious ideas,
  such as the worship of trees, stones and animals. Besides this
  superstitious fetichism it involved ceremonies that were both sensual and
  ribald, including all the wild and mystic rites of the bacchanalia which
  the public authorities were to prohibit a few years later.</p>

  <p>When the senate became better acquainted with the divinity imposed
  upon it by the Sibyls, it must have been quite embarrassed by the present
  of King Attalus. <!-- Page 52 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page52"></a>[52]</span>The enthusiastic transports and the somber
  fanaticism of the Phrygian worship contrasted violently with the calm
  dignity and respectable reserve of the official religion, and excited the
  minds of the people to a dangerous degree. The emasculated Galli were the
  objects of contempt and disgust and what in their own eyes was a
  meritorious act was made a crime punishable by law, at least under the
  empire.<a name="NtA3_8" href="#Nt3_8"><sup>[8]</sup></a> The authorities
  hesitated between the respect due to the powerful goddess that had
  delivered Rome from the Carthaginians and the reverence for the <i>mos
  maiorum</i>. They solved the difficulty by completely isolating the new
  religion in order to prevent its contagion. All citizens were forbidden
  to join the priesthood of the foreign goddess or to participate in her
  sacred orgies. The barbarous rites according to which the Great Mother
  was to be worshiped were performed by Phrygian priests and priestesses.
  The holidays celebrated in her honor by the entire nation, the
  <i>Megalensia</i>, contained no Oriental feature and were organized in
  conformity with Roman traditions.</p>

  <p>A characteristic anecdote told by Diodorus<a name="NtA3_9"
  href="#Nt3_9"><sup>[9]</sup></a> shows what the public feeling was
  towards this Asiatic worship at the end of the republic. In Pompey's time
  a high priest from Pessinus came to Rome, presented himself at the forum
  in his sacerdotal garb, a golden diadem and a long embroidered
  robe&mdash;and pretending that the statue of his goddess had been
  profaned demanded public expiation. But a tribune forbade him to wear the
  royal crown, and the populace rose against him in a mob and compelled him
  to seek refuge in his house. Although apologies were made later, this
  story shows how little the people of that period felt <!-- Page 53
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page53"></a>[53]</span>the veneration
  that attached to Cybele and her clergy after a century had passed.</p>

  <p>Kept closely under control, the Phrygian worship led an obscure
  existence until the establishment of the empire. That closed the first
  period of its history at Rome. It attracted attention only on certain
  holidays, when its priests marched the streets in procession, dressed in
  motley costumes, loaded with heavy jewelry, and beating tambourines. On
  those days the senate granted them the right to go from house to house to
  collect funds for their temples. The remainder of the year they confined
  themselves to the sacred enclosure of the Palatine, celebrating foreign
  ceremonies in a foreign language. They aroused so little notice during
  this period that almost nothing is known of their practices or of their
  creed. It has even been maintained that Attis was not worshiped together
  with his companion, the Great Mother, during the times of the republic,
  but this is undoubtedly wrong, because the two persons of this divine
  couple must have been as inseparable in the ritual as they were in the
  myths.<a name="NtA3_10" href="#Nt3_10"><sup>[10]</sup></a></p>

  <p>But the Phrygian religion kept alive in spite of police surveillance,
  in spite of precautions and prejudices; a breach had been made in the
  cracked wall of the old Roman principles, through which the entire Orient
  finally gained ingress.</p>

  <p>Directly after the fall of the republic a second divinity from Asia
  Minor, closely related to the Great Mother, became established in the
  capital. During the wars against Mithridates the Roman soldiers learned
  to revere Mâ, the great goddess of the two Comanas, who was worshiped by
  a whole people of hierodules in the ravines of the Taurus and along the
  banks of the <!-- Page 54 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page54"></a>[54]</span>Iris. Like Cybele she was an ancient
  Anatolian divinity and personified fertile nature. Her worship, however,
  had not felt the influence of Thrace, but rather that of the Semites and
  the Persians,<a name="NtA3_11" href="#Nt3_11"><sup>[11]</sup></a> like
  the entire religion of Cappadocia. It is certain that she was identical
  with the Anâhita of the Mazdeans, who was of much the same nature.</p>

  <p>The rites of her cult were even more sanguinary and savage than those
  of Pessinus, and she had assumed or preserved a warlike character that
  gave her a resemblance to the Italian Bellona. The dictator Sulla, to
  whom this invincible goddess of combats had appeared in a dream, was
  prompted by his superstition to introduce her worship into Rome. The
  terrible ceremonies connected with it produced a deep impression. Clad in
  black robes, her "fanatics," as they were called, would turn round and
  round to the sound of drums and trumpets, with their long, loose hair
  streaming, and when vertigo seized them and a state of anesthesia was
  attained, they would strike their arms and bodies great blows with swords
  and axes. The view of the running blood excited them, and they
  besprinkled the statue of the goddess and her votaries with it, or even
  drank it. Finally a prophetic delirium would overcome them, and they
  foretold the future.</p>

  <p>This ferocious worship aroused curiosity at first, but it never gained
  great consideration. It appears that the Cappadocian Bellona joined the
  number of divinities that were subordinated to the <i>Magna Mater</i>
  and, as the texts put it, became her follower (<i>pedisequa</i>).<a
  name="NtA3_12" href="#Nt3_12"><sup>[12]</sup></a> The brief popularity
  enjoyed by this exotic <i>Mâ</i> at the beginning of our era shows,
  nevertheless, the growing <!-- Page 55 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page55"></a>[55]</span>influence of the Orient, and of the
  religions of Asia Minor in particular.</p>

  <p>After the establishment of the empire the apprehensive distrust in
  which the worship of Cybele and Attis had been held gave way to marked
  favor and the original restrictions were withdrawn. Thereafter Roman
  citizens were chosen for <i>archigalli</i>, and the holidays of the
  Phrygian deities were solemnly and officially celebrated in Italy with
  even more pomp than had been displayed at Pessinus.</p>

  <p>According to Johannes Lydus, the Emperor Claudius was the author of
  this change. Doubts have been expressed as to the correctness of the
  statement made by this second-rate compiler, and it has been claimed that
  the transformation in question took place under the Antonines. This is
  erroneous. The testimony of inscriptions corroborates that of the
  Byzantine writer.<a name="NtA3_13" href="#Nt3_13"><sup>[13]</sup></a> In
  spite of his love of archaism, it was Claudius who permitted this
  innovation to be made, and we believe that we can divine the motives of
  his action.</p>

  <p>Under his predecessor, Caligula, the worship of Isis had been
  authorized after a long resistance. Its stirring festivities and imposing
  processions gained considerable popularity. This competition must have
  been disastrous to the priests of the <i>Magna Mater</i>, who were
  secluded in their temple on the Palatine, and Caligula's successor could
  not but grant to the Phrygian goddess, so long established in the city,
  the favor accorded the Egyptian divinity who had been admitted into Rome
  but very recently. In this way Claudius prevented too great an ascendency
  in Italy of this second stranger and supplied a distributary to the
  current of popular superstition. Isis must have been held under great
  <!-- Page 56 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page56"></a>[56]</span>suspicion by a ruler who clung to old
  national institutions.<a name="NtA3_14"
  href="#Nt3_14"><sup>[14]</sup></a></p>

  <p>The Emperor Claudius introduced a new cycle of holidays that were
  celebrated from March 15th to March 27th, the beginning of spring at the
  time of the revival of vegetation, personified in Attis. The various acts
  of this grand mystic drama are tolerably well known. The prelude was a
  procession of <i>cannophori</i> or reed-bearers on the fifteenth;
  undoubtedly they commemorated Cybele's discovery of Attis, who, according
  to the legends, had been exposed while a child on the banks of the
  Sangarius, the largest river of Phrygia, or else this ceremony may have
  been the transformation of an ancient phallephory intended to guarantee
  the fertility of the fields.<a name="NtA3_15"
  href="#Nt3_15"><sup>[15]</sup></a> The ceremonies proper began with the
  equinox. A pine was felled and transferred to the temple of the Palatine
  by a brotherhood that owed to this function its name of "tree-bearers"
  (<i>dendrophori</i>). Wrapped like a corpse in woolen bands and garlands
  of violets, this pine represented Attis dead. This god was originally
  only the spirit of the plants, and the honors given to the "March-tree"<a
  name="NtA3_16" href="#Nt3_16"><sup>[16]</sup></a> in front of the
  imperial palace perpetuated a very ancient agrarian rite of the Phrygian
  peasants. The next day was a day of sadness and abstinence on which the
  believers fasted and mourned the defunct god. The twenty-fourth bore the
  significant name of <i>Sanguis</i> in the calendars. We know that it was
  the celebration of the funeral of Attis, whose manes were appeased by
  means of libations of blood, as was done for any mortal. Mingling their
  piercing cries with the shrill sound of flutes, the Galli flagellated
  themselves and cut their flesh, and neophytes performed the supreme <!--
  Page 57 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page57"></a>[57]</span>sacrifice with the aid of a sharp stone,
  being insensible to pain in their frenzy.<a name="NtA3_17"
  href="#Nt3_17"><sup>[17]</sup></a> Then followed a mysterious vigil
  during which the mystic was supposed to be united as a new Attis with the
  great goddess.<a name="NtA3_18" href="#Nt3_18"><sup>[18]</sup></a> On
  March 25th there was a sudden transition from the shouts of despair to a
  delirious jubilation, the <i>Hilaria</i>. With springtime Attis awoke
  from his sleep of death, and the joy created by his resurrection burst
  out in wild merry-making, wanton masquerades, and luxurious banquets.
  After twenty-four hours of an indispensable rest (<i>requietio</i>), the
  festivities wound up, on the twenty-seventh, with a long and gorgeous
  procession through the streets of Rome and surrounding country districts.
  Under a constant rain of flowers the silver statue of Cybele was taken to
  the river Almo and bathed and purified according to an ancient rite
  (<i>lavatio</i>).</p>

  <p>The worship of the Mother of the Gods had penetrated into the Hellenic
  countries long before it was received at Rome, but in Greece it assumed a
  peculiar form and lost most of its barbarous character. The Greek mind
  felt an unconquerable aversion to the dubious nature of Attis. The
  <i>Magna Mater</i>, who is thoroughly different from her Hellenized
  sister, penetrated into all Latin provinces and imposed herself upon them
  with the Roman religion. This was the case in Spain, Brittany, the
  Danubian countries, Africa and especially in Gaul.<a name="NtA3_19"
  href="#Nt3_19"><sup>[19]</sup></a> As late as the fourth century the car
  of the goddess drawn by steers was led in great state through the fields
  and vineyards of Autun in order to stimulate their fertility.<a
  name="NtA3_20" href="#Nt3_20"><sup>[20]</sup></a> In the provinces the
  <i>dendrophori</i>, who carried the sacred pine in the spring
  festivities, formed associations recognized by the state. These
  associations had charge of the work of our <!-- Page 58 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page58"></a>[58]</span>modern fire departments,
  besides their religious mission. In case of necessity these woodcutters
  and carpenters, who knew how to fell the divine tree of Attis, were also
  able to cut down the timbers of burning buildings. All over the empire
  religion and the brotherhoods connected with it were under the high
  supervision of the quindecimvirs of the capital, who gave the priests
  their insignia. The sacerdotal hierarchy and the rights granted to the
  priesthood and believers were minutely defined in a series of senate
  decrees. These Phrygian divinities who had achieved full naturalization
  and had been placed on the official list of gods, were adopted by the
  populations of the Occident as Roman gods together with the rest. This
  propagation was clearly different from that of any other Oriental
  religion, for here the action of the government aided the tendencies that
  attracted the devout masses to these Asiatic divinities.</p>

  <p>This popular zeal was the result of various causes. Ancient authors
  describe the impression produced upon the masses by those magnificent
  processions in which Cybele passed along on her car, preceded by
  musicians playing captivating melodies, by priests wearing gorgeous
  costumes covered with amulets, and by the long line of votaries and
  members of the fraternities, all barefoot and wearing their insignia. All
  this, however, created only a fleeting and exterior impression upon the
  neophyte, but as soon as he entered the temple a deeper sensation took
  hold of him. He heard the pathetic story of the goddess seeking the body
  of her lover cut down in the prime of his life like the grass of the
  fields. He saw the bloody funeral services in which the cruel death of
  the young man was mourned, <!-- Page 59 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page59"></a>[59]</span>and heard the joyful hymns of triumph, and
  the gay songs that greeted his return to life. By a skilfully arranged
  gradation of feelings the onlookers were uplifted to a state of rapturous
  ecstasy. Feminine devotion in particular found encouragement and
  enjoyment in these ceremonies, and the Great Mother, the fecund and
  generous goddess, was always especially worshiped by the women.</p>

  <p>Moreover, people founded great hopes on the pious practice of this
  religion. Like the Thracians, the Phrygians began very early to believe
  in the immortality of the soul. Just as Attis died and came to life again
  every year, these believers were to be born to new life after their
  death. One of the sacred hymns said: "Take courage, oh mystics, because
  the god is saved; and for you also will come salvation from your
  trials."<a name="NtA3_21" href="#Nt3_21"><sup>[21]</sup></a> Even the
  funeral ceremonies were affected by the strength of that belief. In some
  cities, especially at Amphipolis in Macedonia, graves have been found
  adorned with earthenware statuettes representing the shepherd Attis;<a
  name="NtA3_22" href="#Nt3_22"><sup>[22]</sup></a> and even in Germany the
  gravestones are frequently decorated with the figure of a young man in
  Oriental costume, leaning dejectedly upon a knotted stick (<i>pedum</i>),
  who represented the same Attis. We are ignorant of the conception of
  immortality held by the Oriental disciples of the Phrygian priests.
  Maybe, like the votaries of Sabazius, they believed that the blessed ones
  were permitted to participate with Hermes Psychopompos in a great
  celestial feast, for which they were prepared by the sacred repasts of
  the mysteries.<a name="NtA3_23" href="#Nt3_23"><sup>[23]</sup></a> <!--
  Page 60 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page60"></a>[60]</span></p>

  <p>Another agent in favor of this imported religion was, as we have
  stated above, the fact of its official recognition. This placed it in a
  privileged position among Oriental religions, at least at the beginning
  of the imperial régime. It enjoyed a toleration that was neither
  precarious nor limited; it was not subjected to arbitrary police measures
  nor to coercion on the part of magistrates; its fraternities were not
  continually threatened with dissolution, nor its priests with expulsion.
  It was publicly authorized and endowed, its holidays were marked in the
  calendars of the pontiffs, its associations of dendrophori were organs of
  municipal life in Italy and in the provinces, and had a corporate
  entity.</p>

  <p>Therefore it is not surprising that other foreign religions, after
  being transferred to Rome, sought to avert the dangers of an illicit
  existence by an alliance with the Great Mother. The religion of the
  latter frequently consented to agreements and compromises, from which it
  gained in reality as much as it gave up. In exchange for material
  advantages it acquired complete moral authority over the gods that
  accepted its protection. Thus Cybele and Attis absorbed a majority of the
  divinities from Asia Minor that had crossed the Ionian Sea. Their clergy
  undoubtedly intended to establish a religion complex enough to enable the
  emigrants from every part of the vast peninsula, slaves, merchants,
  soldiers, functionaries, scholars, in short, people of all classes of
  society, to find their national and favorite devotions in it. As a matter
  of fact no other Anatolian god could maintain his independence side by
  side with the deities of Pessinus.<a name="NtA3_24"
  href="#Nt3_24"><sup>[24]</sup></a></p>

  <p>We do not know the internal development of the <!-- Page 61 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page61"></a>[61]</span>Phrygian mysteries
  sufficiently to give details of the addition of each individual part. But
  we can prove that in the course of time certain religions were added to
  the one that had been practised in the temple of the Palatine ever since
  the republic.</p>

  <p>In the inscriptions of the fourth century, Attis bears the cognomen of
  <i>menotyrannus</i>. At that time this name was undoubtedly understood to
  mean "lord of the months," because Attis represented the sun who entered
  a new sign of the zodiac every month.<a name="NtA3_25"
  href="#Nt3_25"><sup>[25]</sup></a> But that was not the original meaning
  of the term. "<i>Mèn tyrannus</i>" appears with quite a different meaning
  in many inscriptions found in Asia Minor. <i>Tyrannos</i> <span
  class="extra" title="moved from footnote">(<span title="Turannos"
  class="grk">&Tau;&#x1F7B;&rho;&alpha;&nu;&nu;&omicron;&sigmaf;</span>)</span>,
  "lord," is a word taken by the Greeks from the Lydian, and the honorable
  title of "tyrant" was given to Mèn, an old barbarian divinity worshiped
  by all Phrygia and surrounding regions.<a name="NtA3_26"
  href="#Nt3_26"><sup>[26]</sup></a> The Anatolian tribes from Caria to the
  remotest mountains of Pontus worshiped a lunar god under that name who
  was supposed to rule not only the heavens but also the underworld,
  because the moon was frequently brought into connection with the somber
  kingdom of the dead. The growth of plants and the increase of cattle and
  poultry were ascribed to his celestial influence, and the villagers
  invoked his protection for their farms and their district. They also
  placed their rural burial grounds under the safeguard of this king of
  shadows. No god enjoyed greater popularity in the country districts.</p>

  <p>This powerful divinity penetrated into Greece at an early period.
  Among the mixed populations of the Ægean seaports, in the Piræus, at
  Rhodes, Delos and Thasos, religious associations for his worship were
  <!-- Page 62 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page62"></a>[62]</span>founded. In Attica the presence of the cult
  can be traced back to the fourth century, and its monuments rival those
  of Cybele in number and variety. In the Latin Occident, however, no trace
  of it can be found, because it had been absorbed by the worship of
  <i>Magna Mater</i>. In Asia itself, Attis and Mèn were sometimes
  considered identical, and this involved the Roman world in a complete
  confusion of those two persons, who in reality were very different. A
  marble statue discovered at Ostia represents Attis holding the lunar
  crescent, which was the characteristic emblem of Mèn. His assimilation to
  the "tyrant" of the infernal regions transformed the shepherd of Ida into
  a master of the underworld, an office that he combined with his former
  one as author of resurrection.</p>

  <p>A second title that was given to him reveals another influence. A
  certain Roman inscription is dedicated to Attis the Supreme <span
  class="extra" title="moved from footnote">(<span title="Attei hupsistôi"
  class="grk">&#x1F0C;&tau;&tau;&epsilon;&iota;
  &#x1F51;&psi;&#x1F77;&sigma;&tau;&#x1FF3;</span>)</span>.<a
  name="NtA3_27" href="#Nt3_27"><sup>[27]</sup></a> This epithet is very
  significant. In Asia Minor "Hypsistos" was the appellation used to
  designate the god of Israel.<a name="NtA3_28"
  href="#Nt3_28"><sup>[28]</sup></a> A number of pagan thiasi had arisen
  who, though not exactly submitting to the practice of the synagogue, yet
  worshiped none but the Most High, the Supreme God, the Eternal God, God
  the Creator, to whom every mortal owed service. These must have been the
  attributes ascribed to Cybele's companion by the author of the
  inscription, because the verse continues: <span class="extra"
  title="moved from footnote">(<span title="kai sunechonti to pan"
  class="grk">&kappa;&alpha;&#x1F76;
  &sigma;&upsilon;&nu;&#x1F73;&chi;&omicron;&nu;&tau;&iota; &tau;&#x1F78;
  &pi;&#x1FB6;&nu;</span>)</span> "To thee, who containest and maintainest
  all things."<a name="NtA3_29" href="#Nt3_29"><sup>[29]</sup></a> Must we
  then believe that Hebraic monotheism had some influence upon the
  mysteries of the Great Mother? This is not at all improbable. We know
  that numerous Jewish colonies were established in Phrygia by the
  Seleucides, and that <!-- Page 63 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page63"></a>[63]</span>these expatriated Jews agreed to certain
  compromises in order to conciliate their hereditary faith with that of
  the pagans in whose midst they lived. It is also possible that the clergy
  of Pessinus suffered the ascendancy of the Biblical theology. Under the
  empire Attis and Cybele became the "almighty gods" (<i>omnipotentes</i>)
  <i>par excellence</i>, and it is easy to see in this new conception a
  leaning upon Semitic or Christian doctrines, more probably upon Semitic
  ones.<a name="NtA3_30" href="#Nt3_30"><sup>[30]</sup></a></p>

  <p>We shall now take up the difficult question of the influence of
  Judaism upon the mysteries during the Alexandrian period and at the
  beginning of the empire. Many scholars have endeavored to define the
  influence exercised by the pagan beliefs on those of the Jews; it has
  been shown how the Israelitic monotheism became Hellenized at Alexandria
  and how the Jewish propaganda attracted proselytes who revered the one
  God, without, however, observing all the prescriptions of the Mosaic law.
  But no successful researches have been made to ascertain how far paganism
  was modified through an infiltration of Biblical ideas. Such a
  modification must necessarily have taken place to some extent. A great
  number of Jewish colonies were scattered everywhere on the Mediterranean,
  and these were long animated with such an ardent spirit of proselytism
  that they were bound to impose some of their conceptions on the pagans
  that surrounded them. The magical texts which are almost the only
  original literary documents of paganism we possess, clearly reveal this
  mixture of Israelitic theology with that of other peoples. In them we
  frequently find names like Iao (Yahveh), Sabaoth, or the names of angels
  side by side with those of Egyptian or Greek divinities. Especially in
  Asia <!-- Page 64 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page64"></a>[64]</span>Minor, where the Israelites formed a
  considerable and influential element of the population, an intermingling
  of the old native traditions and the religion of the strangers from the
  other side of the Taurus must have occurred.</p>

  <p>This mixture certainly took place in the mysteries of Sabazius, the
  Phrygian Jupiter or Dionysus.<a name="NtA3_31"
  href="#Nt3_31"><sup>[31]</sup></a> They were very similar to those of
  Attis, with whom he was frequently confounded. By means of an audacious
  etymology that dates back to the Hellenistic period, this old
  Thraco-Phrygian divinity has been identified with "Yahveh Zebaoth," the
  Biblical "Lord of Hosts." The corresponding expression <span
  class="extra" title="moved from footnote">(<span title="kurios Sabaôth"
  class="grk">&kappa;&#x1F7B;&rho;&iota;&omicron;&sigmaf;
  &Sigma;&alpha;&beta;&alpha;&#x1F7D;&theta;</span>)</span> in the
  Septuagint has been regarded as the equivalent of the <i>kurios
  Sabazios</i> <span class="extra" title="moved from footnote">(<span
  title="kurios Sabazios" class="grk"
  >&kappa;&#x1F7B;&rho;&iota;&omicron;&sigmaf;
  &Sigma;&alpha;&beta;&#x1F71;&zeta;&iota;&omicron;&sigmaf;</span>)</span>
  of the barbarians. The latter was worshiped as the supreme, almighty and
  holy Lord. In the light of a new interpretation the purifications
  practised in the mysteries were believed to wipe out the hereditary
  impurity of a guilty ancestor who had aroused the wrath of heaven against
  his posterity, much as the original sin with which Adam's disobedience
  had stained the human race was to be wiped out. The custom observed by
  the votaries of Sabazius of dedicating votive hands which made the
  liturgic sign of benediction with the first three fingers extended (the
  <i>benedictio latina</i> of the church) was probably taken from the
  ritual of the Semitic temples through the agency of the Jews. The
  initiates believed, again like the Jews, that after death their good
  angel (<i>angelus bonus</i>) would lead them to the banquet of the
  eternally happy, and the everlasting joys of these banquets were
  anticipated on earth by the liturgic repasts. This celestial feast can
  <!-- Page 65 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page65"></a>[65]</span>be
  seen in a fresco painting on the grave of a priest of Sabazius called
  Vincentius, who was buried in the Christian catacomb of Prætextatus, a
  strange fact for which no satisfactory explanation has as yet been
  furnished. Undoubtedly he belonged to a Jewish-pagan sect that admitted
  neophytes of every race to its mystic ceremonies. In fact, the church
  itself formed a kind of secret society sprung from the synagogue but
  distinct from it, in which Gentiles and the Children of Israel joined in
  a common adoration.</p>

  <p>If it is a fact, then, that Judaism influenced the worship of
  Sabazius, it is very probable that it influenced the cult of Cybele also,
  although in this case the influence cannot be discerned with the same
  degree of certainty. The religion of the Great Mother did not receive
  rejuvenating germs from Palestine only, but it was greatly changed after
  the gods of more distant Persia came and joined it. In the ancient
  religion of the Achemenides, Mithra, the genius of light, was coupled
  with Anâhita, the goddess of the fertilizing waters. In Asia Minor the
  latter was assimilated with the fecund Great Mother, worshiped all over
  the peninsula,<a name="NtA3_32" href="#Nt3_32"><sup>[32]</sup></a> and
  when at the end of the first century of our era the mysteries of Mithra
  spread over the Latin provinces, its votaries built their sacred crypts
  in the shadow of the temples of the <i>Magna Mater</i>.</p>

  <p>Everywhere in the empire the two religions lived in intimate
  communion. By ingratiating themselves with the Phrygian priests, the
  priests of Mithra obtained the support of an official institution and
  shared in the protection granted by the state. Moreover, men alone could
  participate in the secret ceremonies of the Persian liturgy, at least in
  the Occident. Other <!-- Page 66 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page66"></a>[66]</span>mysteries, to which women could be admitted,
  had therefore to be added in order to complete them, and so the mysteries
  of Cybele received the wives and daughters of the Mithraists.</p>

  <p>This union had even more important consequences for the old religion
  of Pessinus than the partial infusion of Judaic beliefs had had. Its
  theology gained a deeper meaning and an elevation hitherto unknown, after
  it had adopted some of the conceptions of Mazdaism.</p>

  <p>The introduction of the taurobolium in the ritual of the <i>Magna
  Mater</i>, where it appeared after the middle of the first century, was
  probably connected with this transformation. We know the nature of this
  sacrifice, of which Prudentius gives a stirring description based on
  personal recollection of the proceeding. On an open platform a steer was
  killed, and the blood dropped down upon the mystic, who was standing in
  an excavation below. "Through the thousand crevices in the wood," says
  the poet, "the bloody dew runs down into the pit. The neophyte receives
  the falling drops on his head, clothes and body. He leans backward to
  have his cheeks, his ears, his lips and his nostrils wetted; he pours the
  liquid over his eyes, and does not even spare his palate, for he moistens
  his tongue with blood and drinks it eagerly."<a name="NtA3_33"
  href="#Nt3_33"><sup>[33]</sup></a> After submitting to this repulsive
  sprinkling he offered himself to the veneration of the crowd. They
  believed that he was purified of his faults, and had become the equal of
  the deity through his red baptism.</p>

  <p>Although the origin of this sacrifice that took place in the mysteries
  of Cybele at Rome is as yet shrouded in obscurity, recent discoveries
  enable us to trace back <!-- Page 67 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page67"></a>[67]</span>very closely the various phases of its
  development. In accordance with a custom prevalent in the entire Orient
  at the beginning of history, the Anatolian lords were fond of pursuing
  and lassoing wild buffalos, which they afterwards sacrificed to the gods.
  Beasts caught during a hunt were immolated, and frequently also prisoners
  of war. Gradually the savagery of this primitive rite was modified until
  finally nothing but a circus play was left. During the Alexandrian period
  people were satisfied with organizing a <i>corrida</i> in the arena, in
  the course of which the victim intended for immolation was seized. This
  is the proper meaning of the terms taurobolium and criobolium <span
  class="extra" title="moved from footnote">(<span title="taurobolion,
  kriobolion."
  class="grk">&tau;&alpha;&upsilon;&rho;&omicron;&beta;&#x1F79;&lambda;&iota;&omicron;&nu;,
  &kappa;&rho;&iota;&omicron;&beta;&#x1F79;&lambda;&iota;&omicron;&nu;.</span>)</span>,
  which had long been enigmas,<a name="NtA3_34"
  href="#Nt3_34"><sup>[34]</sup></a> and which denoted the act of catching
  a steer or a ram by means of a hurled weapon, probably the thong of a
  lasso. Without doubt even this act was finally reduced to a mere sham
  under the Roman empire, but the weapon with which the animal was slain
  always remained a hunting weapon, a sacred boar spear.<a name="NtA3_35"
  href="#Nt3_35"><sup>[35]</sup></a></p>

  <p>The ideas on which the immolation was based were originally just as
  barbarous as the sacrifice itself. It is a matter of general belief among
  savage peoples that one acquires the qualities of an enemy slain in
  battle or of a beast killed in the chase by drinking or washing in the
  blood, or by eating some of the viscera of the body. The blood especially
  has often been considered as the seat of vital energy. By moistening his
  body with the blood of the slaughtered steer, the neophyte believed that
  he was transfusing the strength of the formidable beast into his own
  limbs.</p>

  <p>This naive and purely material conception was soon <!-- Page 68
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page68"></a>[68]</span>modified and
  refined. The Thracians brought into Phrygia, and the Persian magi into
  Cappadocia, the fast spreading belief in the immortality of mankind.
  Under their influence, especially under that of Mazdaism, which made the
  mythical steer the author of creation and of resurrection, the old savage
  practice assumed a more spiritual and more elevated meaning. By complying
  with it, people no longer thought they were acquiring the buffalo's
  strength; the blood, as the principle of life, was no longer supposed to
  renew physical energy, but to cause a temporary or even an eternal
  rebirth of the soul. The descent into the pit was regarded as burial, a
  melancholy dirge accompanied the burial of the old man who had died. When
  he emerged purified of all his crimes by the sprinkling of blood and
  raised to a new life, he was regarded as the equal of a god, and the
  crowd worshiped him from a respectful distance.<a name="NtA3_36"
  href="#Nt3_36"><sup>[36]</sup></a></p>

  <p>The vogue obtained in the Roman empire by the practice of this
  repugnant rite can only be explained by the extraordinary power ascribed
  to it. He who submitted to it was <i>in aeternum renatus</i>,<a
  name="NtA3_37" href="#Nt3_37"><sup>[37]</sup></a> according to the
  inscriptions.</p>

  <p>We could also outline the transformation of other Phrygian ceremonies,
  of which the spirit and sometimes the letter slowly changed under the
  influence of more advanced moral ideas. This is true of the sacred feasts
  attended by the initiates. One of the few liturgic formulas antiquity has
  left us refers to these Phrygian banquets. One hymn says: "I have eaten
  from the tambourine, I have drunk from the cymbal, I have become a mystic
  of Attis." The banquet, which is found in several Oriental religions, was
  sometimes simply the <!-- Page 69 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page69"></a>[69]</span>external sign indicating that the votaries
  of the same divinity formed one large family. Admitted to the sacred
  table, the neophyte was received as the guest of the community and became
  a brother among brothers. The religious bond of the thiasus or
  <i>sodalicium</i> took the place of the natural relationship of the
  family, the gens or the clan, just as the foreign religion replaced the
  worship of the domestic hearth.</p>

  <p>Sometimes other effects were expected of the food eaten in common.
  When the flesh of some animal supposed to be of a divine nature was
  eaten, the votary believed that he became identified with the god and
  that he shared in his substance and qualities. In the beginning the
  Phrygian priests probably attributed the first of these two meanings to
  their barbarous communions.<a name="NtA3_38"
  href="#Nt3_38"><sup>[38]</sup></a> Towards the end of the empire, moral
  ideas were particularly connected with the assimilation of sacred liquor
  and meats taken from the tambourine and cymbal of Attis. They became the
  staff of the spiritual life and were to sustain the votary in his trials;
  at that period he considered the gods as especially "the guardians of his
  soul and thoughts."<a name="NtA3_39"
  href="#Nt3_39"><sup>[39]</sup></a></p>

  <p>As we see, every modification of the conception of the world and of
  man in the society of the empire had its reflection in the doctrine of
  the mysteries. Even the conception of the old deities of Pessinus was
  constantly changing. When astrology and the Semitic religions caused the
  establishment of a solar henotheism as the leading religion at Rome,
  Attis was considered as the sun, "the shepherd of the twinkling stars."
  He was identified with Adonis, Bacchus, Pan, Osiris and Mithra; he was
  made a "polymorphous"<a name="NtA3_40" href="#Nt3_40"><sup>[40]</sup></a>
  being in which all celestial powers manifested <!-- Page 70 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page70"></a>[70]</span>themselves in turn; a
  <i>pantheos</i> who wore the crown of rays and the lunar crescent at the
  same time, and whose various emblems expressed an infinite multiplicity
  of functions.</p>

  <p>When neo-Platonism was triumphing, the Phrygian fable became the
  traditional mould into which subtle exegetists boldly poured their
  philosophic speculations on the creative and stimulating forces that were
  the principles of all material forms, and on the deliverance of the
  divine soul that was submerged in the corruption of this earthly world.
  In his hazy oration on the Mother of the Gods, Julian lost all notion of
  reality on account of his excessive use of allegory and was swept away by
  an extravagant symbolism.<a name="NtA3_41"
  href="#Nt3_41"><sup>[41]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Any religion as susceptible to outside influences as this one was
  bound to yield to the ascendancy of Christianity. From the explicit
  testimony of ecclesiastical writers we know that attempts were made to
  oppose the Phrygian mysteries to those of the church. It was maintained
  that the sanguinary purification imparted by the taurobolium was more
  efficacious than baptism. The food that was taken during the mystic
  feasts was likened to the bread and wine of the communion; the Mother of
  the Gods was undoubtedly placed above the Mother of God, whose son also
  had risen again. A Christian author, writing at Rome about the year 375,
  furnishes some remarkable information on this subject. As we have seen, a
  mournful ceremony was celebrated on March 24th, the <i>dies sanguinis</i>
  in the course of which the <i>galli</i> shed their blood and sometimes
  mutilated themselves in commemoration of the wound that had caused
  Attis's death, ascribing an expiatory and atoning power to the blood thus
  shed. The pagans <!-- Page 71 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page71"></a>[71]</span>claimed that the church had copied their
  most sacred rites by placing her Holy Week at the vernal equinox in
  commemoration of the sacrifice of the cross on which the divine Lamb,
  according to the church, had redeemed the human race. Indignant at these
  blasphemous pretensions, St. Augustine tells of having known a priest of
  Cybele who kept saying: <i>Et ipse Pileatus christianus
  est</i>&mdash;"and even the god with the Phrygian cap [i.&nbsp;e., Attis] is a
  Christian."<a name="NtA3_42" href="#Nt3_42"><sup>[42]</sup></a></p>

  <p>But all efforts to maintain a barbarian religion stricken with moral
  decadence were in vain. On the very spot on which the last taurobolia
  took place at the end of the fourth century, in the <i>Phrygianum</i>,
  stands to-day the basilica of the Vatican.</p>

<hr class="short" >

  <p>There is no Oriental religion whose progressive evolution we could
  follow at Rome so closely as the cult of Cybele and Attis, none that
  shows so plainly one of the reasons that caused their common decay and
  disappearance. They all dated back to a remote period of barbarism, and
  from that savage past they inherited a number of myths the odium of which
  could be masked but not eradicated by philosophical symbolism, and
  practices whose fundamental coarseness had survived from a period of rude
  nature worship, and could never be completely disguised by means of
  mystic interpretations. Never was the lack of harmony greater between the
  moralizing tendencies of theologians and the cruel shamelessness of
  tradition. A god held up as the august lord of the universe was the
  pitiful and abject hero of an obscene love affair; the taurobolium,
  performed to satisfy man's most exalted aspirations for spiritual
  purification and immortality, looked like a <!-- Page 72 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page72"></a>[72]</span>shower bath of blood and
  recalled cannibalistic orgies. The men of letters and senators attending
  those mysteries saw them performed by painted eunuchs, ill reputed for
  their infamous morals, who went through dizzy dances similar to those of
  the dancing dervishes and the Aissaouas. We can imagine the repugnance
  these ceremonies caused in everybody whose judgment had not been
  destroyed by a fanatical devotion. Of no other pagan superstition do the
  Christian polemicists speak with such profound contempt, and there is
  undoubtedly a reason for their attitude. But they were in a more
  fortunate position than their pagan antagonists; their doctrine was not
  burdened with barbarous traditions dating back to times of savagery; and
  all the ignominies that stained the old Phrygian religion must not
  prejudice us against it nor cause us to slight the long continued efforts
  that were made to refine it gradually and to mould it into a form that
  would fulfil the new demands of morality and enable it to follow the
  laborious march of Roman society on the road of religious progress.</p>

<h3>EGYPT.</h3>

  <p>We know more about the religion of the early Egyptians than about any
  other ancient religion. Its development can be traced back three or four
  thousand years; we can read its sacred texts, mythical narratives, hymns,
  rituals, and the Book of the Dead in the original, and we can ascertain
  its various ideas as to the nature of the divine powers and of future
  life. A great number of monuments have preserved for our inspection the
  pictures of divinities and representations of liturgic scenes, while
  numerous inscriptions and papyri enlighten us in regard to the sacerdotal
  organization of the principal temples. It would seem that the enormous
  quantity of documents of all kinds that have been deciphered in the
  course of nearly an entire century should have dispelled every
  uncertainty about the creed of ancient Egypt, and should have furnished
  exact information with regard to the sources and original character of
  the worship which the Greeks and the Romans borrowed from the subjects of
  the Ptolemies.</p>

  <p>And yet, this is not the case. While of the four great Oriental
  religions which were transplanted into the Occident, the religion of Isis
  and Serapis is the one whose relation to the ancient belief of the mother
  country we can establish with greatest accuracy, we <!-- Page 74 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page74"></a>[74]</span>know very little of its
  first form and of its nature before the imperial period, when it was held
  in high esteem.</p>

  <p>One fact, however, appears to be certain. The Egyptian worship that
  spread over the Greco-Roman world came from the Serapeum founded at
  Alexandria by Ptolemy Soter, somewhat in the manner of Judaism that
  emanated from the temple of Jerusalem. But the earliest history of that
  famous sanctuary is surrounded by such a thick growth of pious legends,
  that the most sagacious investigators have lost their way in it. Was
  Serapis of native origin, or was he imported from Sinope or Seleucia, or
  even from Babylon? Each of these opinions has found supporters very
  recently. Is his name derived from that of the Egyptian god Osiris-Apis,
  or from that of the Chaldean deity Sar-Apsi? <i>Grammatici certant</i>.<a
  name="NtA4_1" href="#Nt4_1"><sup>[1]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Whichever solution we may adopt, one fact remains, namely, that
  Serapis and Osiris were either immediately identified or else were
  identical from the beginning. The divinity whose worship was started at
  Alexandria by Ptolemy was the god that ruled the dead and shared his
  immortality with them. He was fundamentally an Egyptian god, and the most
  popular of the deities of the Nile. Herodotus says that Isis and Osiris
  were revered by every inhabitant of the country, and their traditional
  holidays involved secret ceremonies whose sacred meaning the Greek writer
  dared not reveal.<a name="NtA4_2" href="#Nt4_2"><sup>[2]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Recognizing their Osiris in Serapis, the Egyptians readily accepted
  the new cult. There was a tradition that a new dynasty should introduce a
  new god or give a sort of preeminence to the god of its own district.
  From time immemorial politics had changed the <!-- Page 75 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page75"></a>[75]</span>government of heaven when
  changing that of earth. Under the Ptolemies the Serapis of Alexandria
  naturally became one of the principal divinities of the country, just as
  the Ammon of Thebes had been the chief of the celestial hierarchy under
  the Pharaohs of that city, or as, under the sovereigns from Sais, the
  local Neith had the primacy. At the time of the Antonines there were
  forty-two Serapeums in Egypt.<a name="NtA4_3"
  href="#Nt4_3"><sup>[3]</sup></a></p>

  <p>But the purpose of the Ptolemies was not to add one more Egyptian god
  to the countless number already worshiped by their subjects. They wanted
  this god to unite in one common worship the two races inhabiting the
  kingdom, and thus to further a complete fusion. The Greeks were obliged
  to worship him side by side with the natives. It was a clever political
  idea to institute a Hellenized Egyptian religion at Alexandria. A
  tradition mentioned by Plutarch<a name="NtA4_4"
  href="#Nt4_4"><sup>[4]</sup></a> has it that Manetho, a priest from
  Heliopolis, a man of advanced ideas, together with Timotheus, a Eumolpid
  from Eleusis, thought out the character that would best suit the
  newcomer. The result was that the composite religion founded by the
  Lagides became a combination of the old creed of the Pharaohs and the
  Greek mysteries.</p>

  <p>First of all, the liturgic language was no longer the native idiom but
  Greek. This was a radical change. The philosopher Demetrius of Phalerum,
  who had been cured of blindness by Serapis, composed poems in honor of
  the god that were still sung under the Cæsars several centuries later.<a
  name="NtA4_5" href="#Nt4_5"><sup>[5]</sup></a> We can easily imagine that
  the poets, who lived on the bounty of the Ptolemies, vied with each other
  in their efforts to celebrate their benefactors' god, and the old rituals
  that were translated from the Egyptian were also enriched with <!-- Page
  76 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page76"></a>[76]</span>edifying bits
  of original inspiration. A hymn to Isis, found on a marble monument in
  the island of Andros,<a name="NtA4_6" href="#Nt4_6"><sup>[6]</sup></a>
  gives us some idea of these sacred compositions, although it is of more
  recent date.</p>

  <p>In the second place, the artists replaced the old hieratic idols by
  more attractive images and gave them the beauty of the immortals. It is
  not known who created the figure of Isis draped in a linen gown with a
  fringed cloak fastened over the breast, whose sweet meditative,
  graciously maternal face is a combination of the ideals imagined for Hera
  and Aphrodite. But we know the sculptor of the first statue of Serapis
  that stood in the great sanctuary of Alexandria until the end of
  paganism. This statue, the prototype of all the copies that have been
  preserved, is a colossal work of art made of precious materials by a
  famous Athenian sculptor named Bryaxis, a contemporary of Scopas. It was
  one of the last divine creations of Hellenic genius. The majestic head,
  with its somber and yet benevolent expression, with its abundance of
  hair, and with a crown in the shape of a bushel, bespoke the double
  character of a god ruling at the same time both the fertile earth and the
  dismal realm of the dead.<a name="NtA4_7"
  href="#Nt4_7"><sup>[7]</sup></a></p>

  <p>As we see, the Ptolemies had given their new religion a literary and
  artistic shape that was capable of attracting the most refined and
  cultured minds. But the adaptation to the Hellenic feeling and thinking
  was not exclusively external. Osiris, the god whose worship was thus
  renewed, was more adapted than any other to lend his authority to the
  formation of a syncretic faith. At a very early period, in fact before
  the time of Herodotus, Osiris had been identified with Dionysus, and Isis
  with Demeter. M. Foucart has <!-- Page 77 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page77"></a>[77]</span>endeavored to prove in an ingenious essay
  that this assimilation was not arbitrary, that Osiris and Isis came into
  Crete and Attica during the prehistoric period, and that they were
  mistaken for Dionysus and Demeter<a name="NtA4_8"
  href="#Nt4_8"><sup>[8]</sup></a> by the people of those regions. Without
  going back to those remote ages, we shall merely say with him that the
  mysteries of Dionysus were connected with those of Osiris by far-reaching
  affinities, not simply by superficial and fortuitous resemblances. Each
  commemorated the history of a god governing both vegetation and the
  underworld at the same time, who was put to death and torn to pieces by
  an enemy, and whose scattered limbs were collected by a goddess, after
  which he was miraculously revived. The Greeks must have been very willing
  to adopt a worship in which they found their own divinities and their own
  myths again with something more poignant and more magnificent added. It
  is a very remarkable fact that of all the many deities worshiped by the
  Egyptian districts those of the immediate neighborhood, or if you like,
  the cycle of Osiris, his wife Isis, their son Harpocrates and their
  faithful servant Anubis, were the only ones that were adopted by the
  Hellenic populations. All other heavenly or infernal spirits worshiped by
  the Egyptians remained strangers to Greece.<a name="NtA4_9"
  href="#Nt4_9"><sup>[9]</sup></a></p>

  <p>In the Greco-Latin literature we notice two opposing attitudes toward
  the Egyptian religion. It was regarded as the highest and the lowest of
  religions at the same time, and as a matter of fact there was an abyss
  between the always ardent popular beliefs and the enlightened faith of
  the official priests. The Greeks and Romans gazed with admiration upon
  the splendor of the temples and ceremonial, upon the fabulous <!-- Page
  78 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page78"></a>[78]</span>antiquity of
  the sacred traditions and upon the erudition of a clergy possessed of a
  wisdom that had been revealed by divinity. In becoming the disciples of
  that clergy, they imagined they were drinking from the pure fountain
  whence their own myths had sprung. They were overawed by the pretensions
  of a clergy that prided itself on a past in which it kept on living, and
  they strongly felt the attraction of a marvelous country where everything
  was mysterious, from the Nile that had created it to the hieroglyphs
  engraved upon the walls of its gigantic edifices.<a name="NtA4_10"
  href="#Nt4_10"><sup>[10]</sup></a> At the same time they were shocked by
  the coarseness of its fetichism and by the absurdity of its
  superstitions. Above all they felt an unconquerable repulsion at the
  worship of animals and plants, which had always been the most striking
  feature of the vulgar Egyptian religion and which, like all other archaic
  devotions, seems to have been practised with renewed fervor after the
  accession of the Saite dynasty. The comic writers and the satirists never
  tired of scoffing at the adorers of the cat, the crocodile, the leek and
  the onion. Juvenal says ironically: "O holy people, whose very
  kitchen-gardens produce gods."<a name="NtA4_11"
  href="#Nt4_11"><sup>[11]</sup></a> In a general way, this strange people,
  entirely separated from the remainder of the world, were regarded with
  about the same kind of feeling that Europeans entertained toward the
  Chinese for a long time.</p>

  <p>A purely Egyptian worship would not have been acceptable to the
  Greco-Latin world. The main merit of the mixed creation of the political
  genius of the Ptolemies consisted in the rejection or modification of
  everything repugnant or monstrous like the phallophories of Abydos, and
  in the retention of none but <!-- Page 79 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page79"></a>[79]</span>stirring or attractive elements. It was the
  most civilized of all barbarian religions; it retained enough of the
  exotic element to arouse the curiosity of the Greeks, but not enough to
  offend their delicate sense of proportion, and its success was
  remarkable.</p>

  <p>It was adopted wherever the authority or the prestige of the Lagides
  was felt, and wherever the relations of Alexandria, the great commercial
  metropolis, extended. The Lagides induced the rulers and the nations with
  whom they concluded alliances to accept it. King Nicocreon introduced it
  into Cyprus after having consulted the oracle of the Serapeum,<a
  name="NtA4_12" href="#Nt4_12"><sup>[12]</sup></a> and Agathocles
  introduced it into Sicily, at the time of his marriage with the
  daughter-in-law of Ptolemy I (298).<a name="NtA4_13"
  href="#Nt4_13"><sup>[13]</sup></a> At Antioch, Seleucus Callinicus built
  a sanctuary for the statue of Isis sent to him from Memphis by Ptolemy
  Euergetes.<a name="NtA4_14" href="#Nt4_14"><sup>[14]</sup></a> In token
  of his friendship Ptolemy Soter introduced his god Serapis into Athens,
  where the latter had a temple at the foot of the Acropolis<a
  name="NtA4_15" href="#Nt4_15"><sup>[15]</sup></a> ever after, and
  Arsinoë, his mother or wife, founded another at Halicarnassus, about the
  year 307.<a name="NtA4_16" href="#Nt4_16"><sup>[16]</sup></a> In this
  manner the political activity of the Egyptian dynasty was directed toward
  having the divinities, whose glory was in a certain measure connected
  with that of their house, recognized everywhere. Through Apuleius we know
  that under the empire the priests of Isis mentioned the ruling sovereign
  first of all in their prayers.<a name="NtA4_17"
  href="#Nt4_17"><sup>[17]</sup></a> And this was simply an imitation of
  the grateful devotion which their predecessors had felt toward the
  Ptolemies.</p>

  <p>Protected by the Egyptian squadrons, sailors and merchants propagated
  the worship of Isis, the goddess of navigators, simultaneously on the
  coasts of Syria, <!-- Page 80 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page80"></a>[80]</span>Asia Minor and Greece, in the islands of the
  Archipelago,<a name="NtA4_18" href="#Nt4_18"><sup>[18]</sup></a> and as
  far as the Hellespont and Thrace.<a name="NtA4_19"
  href="#Nt4_19"><sup>[19]</sup></a> At Delos, where the inscriptions
  enable us to study this worship somewhat in detail, it was not merely
  practised by strangers, but the very sacerdotal functions were performed
  by members of the Athenian aristocracy. A number of funereal bas-reliefs,
  in which the deified dead wears the <i>calathos</i> of Serapis on his
  head, prove the popularity of the belief in future life propagated by
  these mysteries. According to the Egyptian faith he was identified with
  the god of the dead.<a name="NtA4_20"
  href="#Nt4_20"><sup>[20]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Even after the splendor of the court of Alexandria had faded and
  vanished; even after the wars against Mithridates and the growth of
  piracy had ruined the traffic of the Ægean Sea, the Alexandrian worship
  was too deeply rooted in the soil of Greece to perish, although it became
  endangered in certain seaports like Delos. Of all the gods of the Orient,
  Isis and Serapis were the only ones that retained a place among the great
  divinities of the Hellenic world until the end of paganism.<a
  name="NtA4_21" href="#Nt4_21"><sup>[21]</sup></a></p>

<hr class="short" >

  <p>It was this syncretic religion that came to Rome after having enjoyed
  popularity in the eastern Mediterranean. Sicily and the south of Italy
  were more than half Hellenized, and the Ptolemies had diplomatic
  relations with these countries, just as the merchants of Alexandria had
  commercial relations with them. For this reason the worship of Isis
  spread as rapidly in those regions as on the coasts of Ionia or in the
  Cyclades.<a name="NtA4_22" href="#Nt4_22"><sup>[22]</sup></a> It was
  introduced into Syracuse and Catana during the earliest years of the
  third century by <!-- Page 81 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page81"></a>[81]</span>Agathocles. The Serapeum of Pozzuoli, at
  that time the busiest seaport of Campania, was mentioned in a city
  ordinance of the year 105 B.&nbsp;C.<a name="NtA4_23"
  href="#Nt4_23"><sup>[23]</sup></a> About the same time an Iseum was
  founded at Pompeii, where the decorative frescos attest to this day the
  power of expansion possessed by the Alexandrian culture.</p>

  <p>After its adoption by the southern part of the Italian peninsula, this
  religion was bound to penetrate rapidly to Rome. Ever since the second
  century before our era, it could not help but find adepts in the
  chequered multitude of slaves and freedmen. Under the Antonines the
  college of the <i>pastophori</i> recalled that it had been founded in the
  time of Sulla.<a name="NtA4_24" href="#Nt4_24"><sup>[24]</sup></a> In
  vain did the authorities try to check the invasion of the Alexandrian
  gods. Five different times, in 59, 58, 53, and 48 B.&nbsp;C., the senate
  ordered their altars and statues torn down,<a name="NtA4_25"
  href="#Nt4_25"><sup>[25]</sup></a> but these violent measures did not
  stop the diffusion of the new beliefs. The Egyptian mysteries were the
  first example at Rome of an essentially popular religious movement that
  was triumphant over the continued resistance of the public authorities
  and the official clergy.</p>

  <p>Why was this Egyptian worship the only one of all Oriental religions
  to suffer repeated persecutions? There were two motives, one religious
  and one political.</p>

  <p>In the first place, this cult was said to exercise a corrupting
  influence perversive of piety. Its morals were loose, and the mystery
  surrounding it excited the worst suspicions. Moreover, it appealed
  violently to the emotions and senses. All these factors offended the
  grave decency that a Roman was wont to <!-- Page 82 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page82"></a>[82]</span>maintain in the presence
  of the gods. The innovators had every defender of the <i>mos maiorum</i>
  for an adversary.</p>

  <p>In the second place, this religion had been founded, supported and
  propagated by the Ptolemies; it came from a country that was almost
  hostile to Italy during the last period of the republic;<a name="NtA4_26"
  href="#Nt4_26"><sup>[26]</sup></a> it issued from Alexandria, whose
  superiority Rome felt and feared. Its secret societies, made up chiefly
  of people of the lower classes, might easily become clubs of agitators
  and haunts of spies. All these motives for suspicion and hatred were
  undoubtedly more potent in exciting persecution than the purely
  theological reasons, and persecution was stopped or renewed according to
  the vicissitudes of general politics.</p>

  <p>As we have stated, the chapels consecrated to Isis were demolished in
  the year 48 B.&nbsp;C. After Cæsar's death, the triumvirs decided in 43 B.&nbsp;C.
  to erect a temple in her honor out of the public funds, undoubtedly to
  gain the favor of the masses. This action would have implied official
  recognition, but the project appears never to have been executed. If
  Antony had succeeded at Actium, Isis and Serapis would have entered Rome
  in triumph, but they were vanquished with Cleopatra; and when Augustus
  had become the master of the empire, he professed a deep aversion for the
  gods of his former enemies. Moreover, he could not have suffered the
  intrusion of the Egyptian clergy into the Roman sacerdotal class, whose
  guardian, restorer and chief he was. In 28 B.&nbsp;C. an ordinance was issued
  forbidding the erecting of altars to the Alexandrian divinities inside
  the sacred enclosure of the <i>pomerium</i>, and seven years later
  Agrippa extended this prohibitive regulation to a radius of a thousand
  paces around the <!-- Page 83 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page83"></a>[83]</span>city. Tiberius acted on the same principle
  and in 19 A.&nbsp;D. instituted the bloodiest persecution against the priests
  of Isis that they ever suffered, in consequence of a scandalous affair in
  which a matron, a noble and some priests of Isis were implicated.</p>

  <p>All these police measures, however, were strangely ineffectual. The
  Egyptian worship was excluded from Rome and her immediate neighborhood in
  theory if not in fact, but the rest of the world remained open to its
  propaganda.<a name="NtA4_27" href="#Nt4_27"><sup>[27]</sup></a></p>

  <p>With the beginning of the empire it slowly invaded the center and the
  north of Italy and spread into the provinces. Merchants, sailors, slaves,
  artisans, Egyptian men of letters, even the discharged soldiers of the
  three legions cantoned in the valley of the Nile contributed to its
  diffusion. It entered Africa by way of Carthage, and the Danubian
  countries through the great emporium of Aquileia. The new province of
  Gaul was invaded through the valley of the Rhone. At that period many
  Oriental emigrants went to seek their fortunes in these new countries.
  Intimate relations existed between the cities of Arles and Alexandria,
  and we know that a colony of Egyptian Greeks, established at Nimes by
  Augustus, took the gods of their native country thither.<a name="NtA4_28"
  href="#Nt4_28"><sup>[28]</sup></a> At the beginning of our era there set
  in that great movement of conversion that soon established the worship of
  Isis and Serapis from the outskirts of the Sahara to the vallum of
  Britain, and from the mountains of Asturias to the mouths of the
  Danube.</p>

  <p>The resistance still offered by the central power could not last much
  longer. It was impossible to dam in this overflowing stream whose
  thundering waves struck the <!-- Page 84 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page84"></a>[84]</span>shaking walls of the <i>pomerium</i> from
  every side. The prestige of Alexandria seemed invincible. At that period
  the city was more beautiful, more learned, and better policed than Rome.
  She was the model capital, a standard to which the Latins strove to rise.
  They translated the works of the scholars of Alexandria, imitated her
  authors, invited her artists and copied her institutions. It is plain
  that they had also to undergo the ascendancy of her religion. As a matter
  of fact, her fervent believers maintained her sanctuaries, despite the
  law, on the very Capitol. Under Cæsar, Alexandrian astronomers had
  reformed the calendar of the pontiffs, and Alexandrian priests soon
  marked the dates of Isis holidays upon it.</p>

  <p>The decisive step was taken soon after the death of Tiberius. Caligula
  erected the great temple of Isis Campensis on the Campus Martius probably
  in the year 38.<a name="NtA4_29" href="#Nt4_29"><sup>[29]</sup></a> In
  order to spare the sacerdotal susceptibilities, he founded it outside of
  the sacred enclosure of the city of Servius. Later Domitian made one of
  Rome's most splendid monuments of that temple. From that time Isis and
  Serapis enjoyed the favor of every imperial dynasty, the Flavians as well
  as the Antonines and the Severi. About the year 215 Caracalla built an
  Isis temple, even more magnificent than that of Domitian, on the
  Quirinal, in the heart of the city, and perhaps another one on the
  Coelian. As the apologist Minucius Felix states, the Egyptian gods had
  become entirely Roman.<a name="NtA4_30"
  href="#Nt4_30"><sup>[30]</sup></a></p>

  <p>The climax of their power seems to have been reached at the beginning
  of the third century; later on the popular vogue and official support
  went to other divinities, like the Syrian Baals and the Persian <!-- Page
  85 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page85"></a>[85]</span>Mithras. The
  progress of Christianity also deprived them of their power, which was,
  however, still considerable until the end of the ancient world. The Isis
  processions that marched the streets of Rome were described by an eye
  witness as late as the year 394,<a name="NtA4_31"
  href="#Nt4_31"><sup>[31]</sup></a> but in 391 the patriarch Theophilus
  had consigned the Serapeum of Alexandria to the flames, having himself
  struck the first blow with an ax against the colossal statue of the god
  that had so long been the object of a superstitious veneration. Thus the
  prelate destroyed the "very head of idolatry," as Rufinus put it.<a
  name="NtA4_32" href="#Nt4_32"><sup>[32]</sup></a></p>

  <p>As a matter of fact, idolatry received its death blow. The worship of
  the gods of the Ptolemies died out completely between the reigns of
  Theodosius and Justinian,<a name="NtA4_33"
  href="#Nt4_33"><sup>[33]</sup></a> and in accordance with the sad
  prophecy of Hermes Trismegistus<a name="NtA4_34"
  href="#Nt4_34"><sup>[34]</sup></a> Egypt, Egypt herself, lost her
  divinities and became a land of the dead. Of her religions nothing
  remained but fables that were no longer believed, and the only thing that
  reminded the barbarians who came to inhabit the country of its former
  piety, were words engraved on stone.</p>

<hr class="short" >

  <p>This rapid sketch of the history of Isis and Serapis shows that these
  divinities were worshiped in the Latin world for more than five
  centuries. The task of pointing out the transformations of the cult
  during that long period, and the local differences there may have been in
  the various provinces, is reserved for future researches. These will
  undoubtedly find that the Alexandrian worship did not become Latinized
  under the empire, but that its Oriental character became more and more
  pronounced. When Domitian restored the Iseum of the Campus Martius and
  that of Beneventum, he <!-- Page 86 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page86"></a>[86]</span>transferred from the valley of the Nile
  sphinxes, cynocephali and obelisks of black or pink granite bearing
  borders of hieroglyphics of Amasis, Nectanebos or even Rameses II. On
  other obelisks that were erected in the propyleums even the inscriptions
  of the emperors were written in hieroglyphics.<a name="NtA4_35"
  href="#Nt4_35"><sup>[35]</sup></a> Half a century later that true
  dilettante, Hadrian, caused the luxuries of Canopus to be reproduced,
  along with the vale of Tempe, in his immense villa at Tibur, to enable
  him to celebrate his voluptuous feasts under the friendly eyes of
  Serapis. He extolled the merits of the deified Antinous in inscriptions
  couched in the ancient language of the Pharaohs, and set the fashion of
  statues hewn out of black basalt in the Egyptian style.<a name="NtA4_36"
  href="#Nt4_36"><sup>[36]</sup></a> The amateurs of that period affected
  to prefer the hieratic rigidity of the barbarian idols to the elegant
  freedom of Alexandrian art. Those esthetic manifestations probably
  corresponded to religious prejudices, and the Latin worship always
  endeavored to imitate the art of temples in the Nile valley more closely
  than did the Greek. This evolution was in conformity with all the
  tendencies of the imperial period.</p>

  <p>By what secret virtue did the Egyptian religion exercise this
  irresistible influence over the Roman world? What new elements did those
  priests, who made proselytes in every province, give the Roman world? Did
  the success of their preaching mean progress or retrogression from the
  standard of the ancient Roman faith? These are complex and delicate
  questions that would require minute analysis and cautious treatment with
  a constant and exact observation of shades. I am compelled to limit
  myself to a rapid sketch, which, I <!-- Page 87 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page87"></a>[87]</span>fear, will appear rather
  dry and arbitrary, like every generalization.</p>

  <p>The particular doctrines of the mysteries of Isis and Serapis in
  regard to the nature and power of the gods were not, or were but
  incidentally, the reasons for the triumph of these mysteries. It has been
  said that the Egyptian theology always remained in a "fluid state,"<a
  name="NtA4_37" href="#Nt4_37"><sup>[37]</sup></a> or better in a state of
  chaos. It consisted of an amalgamation of disparate legends, of an
  aggregate of particular cults, as Egypt herself was an aggregate of a
  number of districts. This religion never formulated a coherent system of
  generally accepted dogmas. It permitted the coexistence of conflicting
  conceptions and traditions, and all the subtlety of its clergy never
  accomplished, or rather never began, the task of fusing those
  irreconcilable elements into one harmonious synthesis.<a name="NtA4_38"
  href="#Nt4_38"><sup>[38]</sup></a> For the Egyptians there was no
  principle of contradiction. All the heterogeneous beliefs that ever
  obtained in the various districts during the different periods of a very
  long history, were maintained concurrently and formed an inextricable
  confusion in the sacred books.</p>

  <p>About the same state of affairs prevailed in the Occidental worship of
  the Alexandrian divinities. In the Occident, just as in Egypt, there were
  "prophets" in the first rank of the clergy, who learnedly discussed
  religion, but never taught a theological system that found universal
  acceptance. The sacred scribe Cheremon, who became Nero's tutor,
  recognized the stoical theories in the sacerdotal traditions of his
  country.<a name="NtA4_39" href="#Nt4_39"><sup>[39]</sup></a> When the
  eclectic Plutarch speaks of the character of the Egyptian gods, he finds
  it agrees surprisingly with his own philosophy,<a name="NtA4_40"
  href="#Nt4_40"><sup>[40]</sup></a> and when the neo-Platonist <!-- Page
  88 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page88"></a>[88]</span>Iamblichus
  examines them, their character seems to agree with his doctrines. The
  hazy ideas of the Oriental priests enabled every one to see in them the
  phantoms he was pursuing. The individual imagination was given ample
  scope, and the dilettantic men of letters rejoiced in molding these
  malleable doctrines at will. They were not outlined sharply enough, nor
  were they formulated with sufficient precision to appeal to the
  multitude. The gods were everything and nothing; they got lost in a
  <i>sfumato</i>. A disconcerting anarchy and confusion prevailed among
  them. By means of a scientific mixture of Greek, Egyptian and Semitic
  elements "Hermetism"<a name="NtA4_41" href="#Nt4_41"><sup>[41]</sup></a>
  endeavored to create a theological system that would be acceptable to all
  minds, but it seems never to have imposed itself generally on the
  Alexandrian mysteries which were older than itself, and furthermore it
  could not escape the contradictions of Egyptian thought. The religion of
  Isis did not gain a hold on the soul by its dogmatism.</p>

  <p>It must be admitted, however, that, owing to its extreme flexibility,
  this religion was easily adapted to the various centers to which it was
  transferred, and that it enjoyed the valuable advantage of being always
  in perfect harmony with the prevailing philosophy. Moreover, the
  syncretic tendencies of Egypt responded admirably to those that began to
  obtain at Rome. At a very early period henotheistic theories had been
  favorably received in sacerdotal circles, and while crediting the god of
  their own temple with supremacy, the priests admitted that he might have
  a number of different personalities, under which he was worshiped
  simultaneously. In this way the unity of the supreme being was affirmed
  for the thinkers, and polytheism with its <!-- Page 89 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page89"></a>[89]</span>intangible traditions
  maintained for the masses. In the same manner Isis and Osiris had
  absorbed several local divinities under the Pharaohs, and had assumed a
  complex character that was capable of indefinite extension. The same
  process continued under the Ptolemies when the religion of Egypt came
  into contact with Greece. Isis was identified simultaneously with
  Demeter, Aphrodite, Hera, Semele, Io, Tyche, and others. She was
  considered the queen of heaven and hell, of earth and sea. She was "the
  past, the present and the future,"<a name="NtA4_42"
  href="#Nt4_42"><sup>[42]</sup></a> "nature the mother of things, the
  mistress of the elements, born at the beginning of the centuries."<a
  name="NtA4_43" href="#Nt4_43"><sup>[43]</sup></a> She had numberless
  names, an infinity of different aspects and an inexhaustible treasure of
  virtues. In short, she became a pantheistic power that was everything in
  one, <i>una quae est omnia</i>.<a name="NtA4_44"
  href="#Nt4_44"><sup>[44]</sup></a></p>

  <p>The authority of Serapis was no less exalted, and his field no less
  extensive. He also was regarded as a universal god of whom men liked to
  say that he was "unique." <span class="extra" title="moved from footnote"
  >(<span title="Heis Zeus Sarapis" class="grk">&#x1F19;&#x1FD6;&sigmaf;
  &Zeta;&epsilon;&#x1F7A;&sigmaf;
  &Sigma;&#x1F71;&rho;&alpha;&pi;&iota;&sigmaf;</span>)</span> In him all
  energies were centered, although the functions of Zeus, of Pluto or of
  Helios were especially ascribed to him. For many centuries Osiris had
  been worshiped at Abydos both as author of fecundity and lord of the
  underworld,<a name="NtA4_45" href="#Nt4_45"><sup>[45]</sup></a> and this
  double character early caused him to be identified with the sun, which
  fertilizes the earth during its diurnal course and travels through the
  subterranean realms at night. Thus the conception of this nature
  divinity, that had already prevailed along the Nile, accorded without
  difficulty with the solar pantheism that was the last form of Roman
  paganism. This theological system, which did not gain the upper hand in
  the Occident until the <!-- Page 90 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page90"></a>[90]</span>second century of our era, was not brought
  in by Egypt. It did not have the exclusive predominance there that it had
  held under the empire, and even in Plutarch's time it was only one creed
  among many.<a name="NtA4_46" href="#Nt4_46"><sup>[46]</sup></a> The
  deciding influence in this matter was exercised by the Syrian Baals and
  the Chaldean astrology.</p>

  <p>The theology of the Egyptian mysteries, then, followed rather than led
  the general influx of ideas. The same may be said of their ethics. It did
  not force itself upon the world by lofty moral precepts, nor by a sublime
  ideal of holiness. Many have admired the edifying list in the Book of the
  Dead, that rightfully or otherwise sets forth the virtues which the
  deceased claims to have practised in order to obtain a favorable judgment
  from Osiris. If one considers the period in which it appears, this ethics
  is undoubtedly very elevated, but it seems rudimentary and even childish
  if one compares it with the principles formulated by the Roman jurists,
  to say nothing of the minute psychological analyses of the Stoic
  casuists. In this range of ideas also, the maintenance of the most
  striking contrasts characterizes Egyptian mentality, which was never
  shocked by the cruelties and obscenities that sullied the mythology and
  the ritual. Like Epicurus at Athens, some of the sacred texts actually
  invited the believers to enjoy life before the sadness of death.<a
  name="NtA4_47" href="#Nt4_47"><sup>[47]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Isis was not a very austere goddess at the time she entered Italy.
  Identified with Venus, as Harpocrates was with Eros, she was honored
  especially by the women with whom love was a profession. In Alexandria,
  the city of pleasure, she had lost all severity, and at Rome this good
  goddess remained very indulgent to human weaknesses. Juvenal harshly
  refers to <!-- Page 91 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page91"></a>[91]</span>her as a procuress,<a name="NtA4_48"
  href="#Nt4_48"><sup>[48]</sup></a> and her temples had a more than
  doubtful reputation, for they were frequented by young men in quest of
  gallant adventures. Apuleius himself chose a lewd tale in which to
  display his fervor as an initiate.</p>

  <p>But we have said that Egypt was full of contradictions, and when a
  more exacting morality demanded that the gods should make man virtuous,
  the Alexandrian mysteries offered to satisfy that demand.</p>

  <p>At all times the Egyptian ritual attributed considerable importance to
  purity, or, to use a more adequate term, to cleanliness. Before every
  ceremony the officiating priest had to submit to ablutions, sometimes to
  fumigations or anointing, and to abstain from certain foods and from
  incontinence for a certain time. Originally no moral idea was connected
  with this purification. It was considered a means of exorcising
  malevolent demons or of putting the priest into a state in which the
  sacrifice performed by him could have the expected effect. It was similar
  to the diet, shower-baths and massage prescribed by physicians for
  physical health. The internal status of the officiating person was a
  matter of as much indifference to the celestial spirits as the actual
  worth of the deceased was to Osiris, the judge of the underworld. All
  that was necessary to have him open the fields of Aalu to the soul was to
  pronounce the liturgic formulas, and if the soul declared its innocence
  in the prescribed terms its word was readily accepted.</p>

  <p>But in the Egyptian religion, as in all the religions of antiquity,<a
  name="NtA4_49" href="#Nt4_49"><sup>[49]</sup></a> the original conception
  was gradually transformed and a new idea slowly took its place. The
  sacramental acts of purification were now <!-- Page 92 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page92"></a>[92]</span>expected to wipe out
  moral stains, and people became convinced that they made man better. The
  devout female votaries of Isis, whom Juvenal<a name="NtA4_50"
  href="#Nt4_50"><sup>[50]</sup></a> pictures as breaking the ice to bathe
  in the Tiber, and crawling around the temple on their bleeding knees,
  hoped to atone for their sins and to make up for their shortcomings by
  means of these sufferings.</p>

  <p>When a new ideal grew up in the popular conscience during the second
  century, when the magicians themselves became pious and serious people,
  free from passions and appetites, and were honored because of the dignity
  of their lives more than for their white linen robes,<a name="NtA4_51"
  href="#Nt4_51"><sup>[51]</sup></a> then the virtues of which the Egyptian
  priests enjoined the practice also became less external. Purity of the
  heart rather than cleanliness of the body was demanded. Renunciation of
  sensual pleasures was the indispensable condition for the knowledge of
  divinity, which was the supreme good.<a name="NtA4_52"
  href="#Nt4_52"><sup>[52]</sup></a> No longer did Isis favor illicit love.
  In the novel by Xenophon of Ephesus (about 280 A.&nbsp;D.) she protects the
  heroine's chastity against all pitfalls and assures its triumph.
  According to the ancient belief man's entire existence was a preparation
  for the formidable judgment held by Serapis after death, but to have him
  decide in favor of the mystic, it was not enough to know the rites of the
  sect; the individual life had to be free from crime; and the master of
  the infernal regions assigned everybody a place according to his
  deserts.<a name="NtA4_53" href="#Nt4_53"><sup>[53]</sup></a> The doctrine
  of future retribution was beginning to develop.</p>

  <p>However, in this regard, as in their conception of the divinity, the
  Egyptian mysteries followed the general progress of ideas more than they
  directed it. <!-- Page 93 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page93"></a>[93]</span>Philosophy transformed them, but found in
  them little inspiration.</p>

<hr class="short" >

  <p>How could a religion, of which neither the theology nor the ethics was
  really new, stir up at the same time so much hostility and fervor among
  the Romans? To many minds of to-day theology and ethics constitute
  religion, but during the classical period it was different, and the
  priests of Isis and Serapis conquered souls mainly by other means. They
  seduced them by the powerful attraction of the ritual and retained them
  by the marvelous promises of their doctrine of immortality.</p>

  <p>To the Egyptians ritual had a value far superior to that we ascribe to
  it to-day. It had an operative strength of its own that was independent
  of the intentions of the officiating priest. The efficacy of prayer
  depended not on the inner disposition of the believer, but on the
  correctness of the words, gestures and intonation. Religion was not
  clearly differentiated from magic. If a divinity was invoked according to
  the correct forms, especially if one knew how to pronounce its real name,
  it was compelled to act in conformity to the will of its priest. The
  sacred words were an incantation that compelled the superior powers to
  obey the officiating person, no matter what purpose he had in view. With
  the knowledge of the liturgy men acquired an immense power over the world
  of spirits. Porphyry was surprised and indignant because the Egyptians
  sometimes dared to threaten the gods in their orations.<a name="NtA4_54"
  href="#Nt4_54"><sup>[54]</sup></a> In the consecrations the priest's
  summons compelled the gods to come and animate their <!-- Page 94
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page94"></a>[94]</span>statues, and
  thus his voice created divinities,<a name="NtA4_55"
  href="#Nt4_55"><sup>[55]</sup></a> as originally the almighty voice of
  Thoth had created the world.<a name="NtA4_56"
  href="#Nt4_56"><sup>[56]</sup></a></p>

  <p>The ritual that conferred such superhuman power<a name="NtA4_57"
  href="#Nt4_57"><sup>[57]</sup></a> developed in Egypt into a state of
  perfection, completeness and splendor unknown in the Occident. It
  possessed a unity, a precision and a permanency that stood in striking
  contrast to the variety of the myths, the uncertainty of the dogmas and
  the arbitrariness of the interpretations. The sacred books of the
  Greco-Roman period are a faithful reproduction of the texts that were
  engraved upon the walls of the pyramids at the dawn of history,
  notwithstanding the centuries that had passed. Even under the Cæsars the
  ancient ceremonies dating back to the first ages of Egypt, were
  scrupulously performed because the smallest word and the least gesture
  had their importance.</p>

  <p>This ritual and the attitude toward it found their way for the most
  part into the Latin temples of Isis and Serapis. This fact has long been
  ignored, but there can be no doubt about it. A first proof is that the
  clergy of those temples were organized just like those of Egypt during
  the period of the Ptolemies.<a name="NtA4_58"
  href="#Nt4_58"><sup>[58]</sup></a> There was a hierarchy presided over by
  a high priest, which consisted of <i>prophetes</i> skilled in the sacred
  science, <i>stolistes</i>, or <i>ornatrices</i>,<a name="NtA4_59"
  href="#Nt4_59"><sup>[59]</sup></a> whose office it was to dress the
  statues of the gods, <i>pastophori</i> who carried the sacred temple
  plates in the processions, and so on, just as in Egypt. As in their
  native country, the priests were distinguished from common mortals by a
  tonsure, by a linen tunic, and by their habits as well as by their garb.
  They devoted themselves entirely to their ministry and had no other
  profession. This <!-- Page 95 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page95"></a>[95]</span>sacerdotal body always remained Egyptian in
  character, if not in nationality, because the liturgy it had to perform
  remained so. In a similar manner the priests of the Baals were Syrians,<a
  name="NtA4_60" href="#Nt4_60"><sup>[60]</sup></a> because they were the
  only ones that knew how to honor the gods of Syria.</p>

  <p>In the first place a daily service had to be held just as in the Nile
  valley. The Egyptian gods enjoyed a precarious immortality, for they were
  liable to destruction and dependent on necessities. According to a very
  primitive conception that always remained alive, they had to be fed,
  clothed and refreshed every day or else perish. From this fact arose the
  necessity of a liturgy that was practically the same in every district.
  It was practised for thousands of years and opposed its unaltering form
  to the multiplicity of legends and local beliefs.<a name="NtA4_61"
  href="#Nt4_61"><sup>[61]</sup></a></p>

  <p>This daily liturgy was translated into Greek, perhaps later into Latin
  also; it was adapted to the new requirements by the founders of the
  Serapeum, and faithfully observed in the Roman temples of the Alexandrian
  gods. The essential ceremony always was the opening (<i>apertio</i>)<a
  name="NtA4_62" href="#Nt4_62"><sup>[62]</sup></a> of the sanctuary. At
  dawn the statue of the divinity was uncovered and shown to the community
  in the <i>naos</i>, that had been closed and sealed during the night.<a
  name="NtA4_63" href="#Nt4_63"><sup>[63]</sup></a> Then, again as in
  Egypt, the priest lit the sacred fire and offered libations of water
  supposed to be from the deified Nile,<a name="NtA4_64"
  href="#Nt4_64"><sup>[64]</sup></a> while he chanted the usual hymns to
  the sound of flutes. Finally, "erect upon the threshold"&mdash;I
  translate literally from Porphyry&mdash;"he awakens the god by calling to
  him in the Egyptian language."<a name="NtA4_65"
  href="#Nt4_65"><sup>[65]</sup></a> As we see, the god was revived by the
  sacrifice and, as under the Pharaohs, awoke from his slumber at the
  calling of <!-- Page 96 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page96"></a>[96]</span>his name. As a matter of fact the name was
  indissolubly connected with the personality; he who could pronounce the
  exact name of an individual or of a divinity was obeyed as a master by
  his slave.<a name="NtA4_66" href="#Nt4_66"><sup>[66]</sup></a> This fact
  made it necessary to maintain the original form of that mysterious word.
  There was no other motive for the introduction of a number of barbarian
  appellatives into the magical incantations.</p>

  <p>It is also probable that the toilet of the statue was made every day,
  that its body and head were dressed,<a name="NtA4_67"
  href="#Nt4_67"><sup>[67]</sup></a> as in the Egyptian ritual. We have
  seen that the <i>ornatrices</i> or <i>stolistes</i> were especially
  entrusted with these duties. The idol was covered with sumptuous raiment
  and ornamented with jewels and gems. An inscription furnishes us with an
  inventory of the jewels worn by an Isis of ancient Cadiz;<a
  name="NtA4_68" href="#Nt4_68"><sup>[68]</sup></a> her ornaments were more
  brilliant than those of a Spanish madonna.</p>

  <p>During the entire forenoon, from the moment that a noisy acclamation
  had greeted the rising of the sun, the images of the gods were exposed to
  the silent adoration of the initiates.<a name="NtA4_69"
  href="#Nt4_69"><sup>[69]</sup></a> Egypt is the country whence
  contemplative devotion penetrated into Europe. Then, in the afternoon, a
  second service was held to close the sanctuary.<a name="NtA4_70"
  href="#Nt4_70"><sup>[70]</sup></a></p>

  <p>The daily liturgy must have been very absorbing. This innovation in
  the Roman paganism was full of consequences. No longer were sacrifices
  offered to the god on certain occasions only, but twice a day elaborate
  services were held. As with the Egyptians, whom Herodotus had termed the
  most religious of all peoples,<a name="NtA4_71"
  href="#Nt4_71"><sup>[71]</sup></a> devotion assumed a tendency to fill
  out the whole existence and to dominate private and public interests. The
  constant repetition of the same prayers <!-- Page 97 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page97"></a>[97]</span>kept up and renewed
  faith, and, we might say, people lived continually under the eyes of the
  gods.</p>

  <p>Besides the daily rites of the Abydos liturgy the holidays marking the
  beginning of the different seasons were celebrated at the same date every
  year.<a name="NtA4_72" href="#Nt4_72"><sup>[72]</sup></a> It was the same
  in Italy. The calendars have preserved the names of several of them, and
  of one, the <i>Navigium Isidis</i>, the rhetorician Apuleius<a
  name="NtA4_73" href="#Nt4_73"><sup>[73]</sup></a> has left us a brilliant
  description on which, to speak with the ancients, he emptied all his
  color tubes. On March 5th, when navigation reopened after the winter
  months, a gorgeous procession<a name="NtA4_74"
  href="#Nt4_74"><sup>[74]</sup></a> marched to the coast, and a ship
  consecrated to Isis, the protectress of sailors, was launched. A
  burlesque group of masked persons opened the procession, then came the
  women in white gowns strewing flowers, the <i>stolistes</i> waving the
  garments of the goddess and the <i>dadophori</i> with lighted torches.
  After these came the <i>hymnodes</i>, whose songs mingled in turn with
  the sharp sound of the cross-flutes and the ringing of the brass
  timbrels; then the throngs of the initiates, and finally the priests,
  with shaven heads and clad in linen robes of a dazzling white, bearing
  the images of animal-faced gods and strange symbols, as for instance a
  golden urn containing the sacred water of the Nile. The procession
  stopped in front of altars<a name="NtA4_75"
  href="#Nt4_75"><sup>[75]</sup></a> erected along the road, and on these
  altars the sacred objects were uncovered for the veneration of the
  faithful. The strange and sumptuous magnificence of these celebrations
  made a deep impression on the common people who loved public
  entertainments.</p>

  <p>But of all the celebrations connected with the worship of Isis the
  most stirring and the most suggestive <!-- Page 98 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page98"></a>[98]</span>was the commemoration of
  the "Finding of Osiris" (<i>Inventio</i>, <span title="Heuresis" class="grk"
  >&Epsilon;&#x1F55;&rho;&epsilon;&sigma;&iota;&sigmaf;</span>). Its
  antecedents date back to remote antiquity. Since the time of the twelfth
  dynasty, and probably much earlier, there had been held at Abydos and
  elsewhere a sacred performance similar to the mysteries of our Middle
  Ages, in which the events of Osiris's passion and resurrection were
  reproduced. We are in possession of the ritual of those performances.<a
  name="NtA4_76" href="#Nt4_76"><sup>[76]</sup></a> Issuing from the
  temple, the god fell under Set's blows; around his body funeral
  lamentations were simulated, and he was buried according to the rites;
  then Set was vanquished by Horus, and Osiris, restored to life, reentered
  his temple triumphant over death.</p>

  <p>The same myth was represented in almost the same manner at Rome at the
  beginning of each November.<a name="NtA4_77"
  href="#Nt4_77"><sup>[77]</sup></a> While the priests and the believers
  moaned and lamented, Isis in great distress sought the divine body of
  Osiris, whose limbs had been scattered by Typhon. Then, after the corpse
  had been found, rehabilitated and revived, there was a long outburst of
  joy, an exuberant jubilation that rang through the temples and the
  streets so loudly that it annoyed the passers-by.</p>

  <p>This mingled despair and enthusiasm acted as strongly upon the
  feelings of the believers as did the spring-holiday ceremony in the
  Phrygian religion, and it acted through the same means. Moreover, there
  was an esoteric meaning attached to it that none but the pious elect
  understood. Besides the public ceremonies there was a secret worship to
  which one was admitted only after a gradual initiation. The hero of
  Apuleius had to submit to the ordeal three times in order to obtain the
  whole revelation. In Egypt the <!-- Page 99 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page99"></a>[99]</span>clergy communicated certain rites and
  interpretations only upon a promise not to reveal them. In fact this was
  the case in the worship of Isis at Abydos and elsewhere.<a name="NtA4_78"
  href="#Nt4_78"><sup>[78]</sup></a> When the Ptolemies regulated the Greek
  ritual of their new religion, it assumed the form of the mysteries spread
  over the Hellenic world and became very like those of Eleusis. The hand
  of the Eumolpid Timotheus is noticeable in this connection.<a
  name="NtA4_79" href="#Nt4_79"><sup>[79]</sup></a></p>

  <p>But while the ceremonial of the initiations and even the production of
  the liturgic drama were thus adapted to the religious habits of the
  Greeks, the doctrinal contents of the Alexandrian mysteries remained
  purely Egyptian. The old belief that immortality could be secured by
  means of an identification of the deceased with Osiris or Serapis never
  died out.</p>

  <p>Perhaps in no other people did the epigram of Fustel de Coulanges find
  so complete a verification as in the Egyptians: "Death was the first
  mystery; it started man on the road to the other mysteries."<a
  name="NtA4_80" href="#Nt4_80"><sup>[80]</sup></a> Nowhere else was life
  so completely dominated by preoccupation with life after death; nowhere
  else was such minute and complicated care taken to secure and perpetuate
  another existence for the deceased. The funeral literature, of which we
  have found a very great number of documents, had acquired a development
  equaled by no other, and the architecture of no other nation can exhibit
  tombs comparable with the pyramids or the rock-built sepulchers of
  Thebes.</p>

  <p>This constant endeavor to secure an after-existence for one's self and
  relatives manifested itself in various ways, but it finally assumed a
  concrete form in the worship of Osiris. The fate of Osiris, the god who
  died and returned to life, became the prototype of the <!-- Page 100
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page100"></a>[100]</span>fate of every
  human being that observed the funeral rites. "As truly as Osiris lives,"
  says an Egyptian text, "he also shall live; as truly as Osiris is not
  dead, shall he not die; as truly as Osiris is not annihilated, shall he
  not be annihilated."<a name="NtA4_81"
  href="#Nt4_81"><sup>[81]</sup></a></p>

  <p>If, then, the deceased had piously served Osiris-Serapis, he was
  assimilated to that god, and shared his immortality in the underworld,
  where the judge of the dead held forth. He lived not as a tenuous shade
  or as a subtle spirit, but in full possession of his body as well as of
  his soul. That was the Egyptian doctrine, and that certainly was also the
  doctrine of the Greco-Latin mysteries.<a name="NtA4_82"
  href="#Nt4_82"><sup>[82]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Through the initiation the mystic was born again, but to a superhuman
  life, and became the equal of the immortals.<a name="NtA4_83"
  href="#Nt4_83"><sup>[83]</sup></a> In his ecstasy he imagined that he was
  crossing the threshold of death and contemplating the gods of heaven and
  hell face to face.<a name="NtA4_84" href="#Nt4_84"><sup>[84]</sup></a> If
  he had accurately followed the prescriptions imposed upon him by Isis and
  Serapis through their priests, those gods prolonged his life after his
  decease beyond the duration assigned to it by destiny, and he
  participated eternally in their beatitude and offered them his homage in
  their realm.<a name="NtA4_85" href="#Nt4_85"><sup>[85]</sup></a> The
  "unspeakable pleasure" he felt when contemplating the sacred images in
  the temple<a name="NtA4_86" href="#Nt4_86"><sup>[86]</sup></a> became
  perpetual rapture when he was in the divine presence instead of in the
  presence of the image, and drawn close to divinity his thirsting soul
  enjoyed the delights of that ineffable beauty.<a name="NtA4_87"
  href="#Nt4_87"><sup>[87]</sup></a></p>

  <p>When the Alexandrian mysteries spread over Italy under the republic,
  no religion had ever brought to mankind so formal a promise of blest
  immortality as these, and this, more than anything else, lent them an
  <!-- Page 101 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page101"></a>[101]</span>irresistible power of attraction. Instead
  of the vague and contradictory opinions of the philosophers in regard to
  the destiny of the soul, Serapis offered certainty founded on divine
  revelation corroborated by the faith of the countless generations that
  had adhered to it. What the votaries of Orpheus had confusedly discovered
  through the veil of the legends, and taught to Magna Grecia,<a
  name="NtA4_88" href="#Nt4_88"><sup>[88]</sup></a> namely, that this
  earthly life was a trial, a preparation for a higher and purer life, that
  the happiness of an after-life could be secured by means of rites and
  observances revealed by the gods themselves, all this was now preached
  with a firmness and precision hitherto unknown. These eschatological
  doctrines in particular, helped Egypt to conquer the Latin world and
  especially the miserable masses, on whom the weight of all the iniquities
  of Roman society rested heavily.</p>

<hr class="short" >

  <p>The power and popularity of that belief in future life has left traces
  even in the French language, and in concluding this study, from which I
  have been compelled to exclude every picturesque detail, I would like to
  point out how a French word of to-day dimly perpetuates the memory of the
  old Egyptian ideas.</p>

  <p>During the cold nights of their long winters the Scandinavians dreamed
  of a Walhalla where the deceased warriors sat in well-closed brilliantly
  illuminated halls, warming themselves and drinking the strong liquor
  served by the Valkyries; but under the burning sky of Egypt, near the
  arid sand where thirst kills the traveler, people wished that their dead
  might find a limpid spring in their future wanderings to assuage the heat
  that devoured them, and that they might be <!-- Page 102 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page102"></a>[102]</span>refreshed by the
  breezes of the north wind.<a name="NtA4_89"
  href="#Nt4_89"><sup>[89]</sup></a> Even at Rome the adherents of the
  Alexandrian gods frequently inscribed the following wish on their tombs:
  "May Osiris give you fresh water."<a name="NtA4_90"
  href="#Nt4_90"><sup>[90]</sup></a> Soon this water became, in a
  figurative sense, the fountain of life pouring out immortality to
  thirsting souls. The metaphor obtained such popularity that in Latin
  <i>refrigerium</i> became synonymous with comfort and happiness. The term
  retained this meaning in the liturgy of the church,<a name="NtA4_91"
  href="#Nt4_91"><sup>[91]</sup></a> and for that reason people continue to
  pray for spiritual <i>rafraîchissement</i> of the dead although the
  Christian paradise has very little resemblance to the fields of Aalu.</p>

<h3>SYRIA.</h3>

  <p>The religions of Syria never had the same solidarity in the Occident
  as those from Egypt or Asia Minor. From the coasts of Ph&oelig;nicia and
  the valleys of Lebanon, from the borders of the Euphrates and the oases
  of the desert, they came at various periods, like the successive waves of
  the incoming tide, and existed side by side in the Roman world without
  uniting, in spite of their similarities. The isolation in which they
  remained and the persistent adherence of their believers to their
  particular rites were a consequence and reflection of the disunited
  condition of Syria herself, where the different tribes and districts
  remained more distinct than anywhere else, even after they had been
  brought together under the domination of Rome. They doggedly preserved
  their local gods and Semitic dialects.</p>

  <p>It would be impossible to outline each one of these religions in
  detail at this time and to reconstruct their history, because our meager
  information would not permit it, but we can indicate, in a general way,
  how they penetrated into the Occidental countries at various periods, and
  we can try to define their common characteristics by showing what new
  elements the Syrian paganism brought to the Romans.</p>

  <p>The first Semitic divinity to enter Italy was <!-- Page 104 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page104"></a>[104]</span><i>Atargatis</i>,
  frequently mistaken for the Ph&oelig;nician Astarte, who had a famous
  temple at Bambyce or Hierapolis, not far from the Euphrates, and was
  worshiped with her husband, Hadad, in a considerable part of Syria
  besides. The Greeks considered her as the principal Syrian goddess <span
  class="extra" title="moved from footnote">(<span title="Suria thea"
  class="grk">&Sigma;&upsilon;&rho;&#x1F77;&alpha;
  &theta;&epsilon;&#x1F71;</span>)</span>, and in the Latin countries she
  was commonly known as <i>dea Syria</i>, a name corrupted into
  <i>Iasura</i> by popular use.</p>

  <p>We all remember the unedifying descriptions of her itinerant priests
  that Lucian and Apuleius<a name="NtA5_1" href="#Nt5_1"><sup>[1]</sup></a>
  have left. Led by an old eunuch of dubious habits, a crowd of painted
  young men marched along the highways with an ass that bore an elaborately
  adorned image of the goddess. Whenever they passed through a village or
  by some rich villa, they went through their sacred exercises. To the
  shrill accompaniment of their Syrian flutes they turned round and round,
  and with their heads thrown back fluttered about and gave vent to hoarse
  clamors until vertigo seized them and insensibility was complete. Then
  they flagellated themselves wildly, struck themselves with swords and
  shed their blood in front of a rustic crowd which pressed closely about
  them, and finally they took up a profitable collection from the wondering
  spectators. They received jars of milk and wine, cheeses, flour, bronze
  coins of small denominations and even some silver pieces, all of which
  disappeared in the folds of their capacious robes. If opportunity
  presented they knew how to increase their profits by means of clever
  thefts or by making commonplace predictions for a moderate
  consideration.</p>

  <p>This picturesque description, based on a novel by <!-- Page 105
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page105"></a>[105]</span>Lucius of
  Patras, is undoubtedly extreme. It is difficult to believe that the
  sacerdotal corps of the goddess of Hierapolis should have consisted only
  of charlatans and thieves. But how can the presence in the Occident of
  that begging and low nomadic clergy be explained?</p>

  <p>It is certain that the first worshipers of the Syrian goddess in the
  Latin world were slaves. During the wars against Antiochus the Great a
  number of prisoners were sent to Italy to be sold at public auction, as
  was the custom, and the first appearance in Italy of the
  <i>Chaldaei</i><a name="NtA5_2" href="#Nt5_2"><sup>[2]</sup></a> has been
  connected with that event. The <i>Chaldaei</i> were Oriental
  fortune-tellers who asserted that their predictions were based on the
  Chaldean astrology. They found credulous clients among the farm laborers,
  and Cato gravely exhorts the good landlord to oust them from his
  estate.<a name="NtA5_3" href="#Nt5_3"><sup>[3]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Beginning with the second century before Christ, merchants began to
  import Syrian slaves. At that time Delos was the great trade center in
  this human commodity, and in that island especially Atargatis was
  worshiped by citizens of Athens and Rome.<a name="NtA5_4"
  href="#Nt5_4"><sup>[4]</sup></a> Trade spread her worship in the
  Occident.<a name="NtA5_5" href="#Nt5_5"><sup>[5]</sup></a> We know that
  the great slave revolution that devastated Sicily in 134 B.&nbsp;C. was
  started by a slave from Apamea, a votary of the Syrian goddess.
  Simulating divine madness, he called his companions to arms, pretending
  to act in accordance with orders from heaven.<a name="NtA5_6"
  href="#Nt5_6"><sup>[6]</sup></a> This detail, which we know by chance,
  shows how considerable a proportion of Semites there was in the gangs
  working the fields, and how much authority Atargatis enjoyed in the rural
  centers. Being too poor to build temples for their national goddess,
  those agricultural laborers <!-- Page 106 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page106"></a>[106]</span>waited with their devotions until a band
  of itinerant <i>galli</i> passed through the distant hamlet where the lot
  of the auction had sent them. The existence of those wandering priests
  depended, therefore, on the number of fellow-countrymen they met in the
  rural districts, who supported them by sacrificing a part of their poor
  savings.</p>

  <p>Towards the end of the republic those diviners appear to have enjoyed
  rather serious consideration at Rome. It was a pythoness from Syria that
  advised Marius on the sacrifices he was to perform.<a name="NtA5_7"
  href="#Nt5_7"><sup>[7]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Under the empire the importation of slaves increased. Depopulated
  Italy needed more and more foreign hands, and Syria furnished a large
  quota of the forced immigration of cultivators. But those Syrians, quick
  and intelligent as they were strong and industrious, performed many other
  functions. They filled the countless domestic positions in the palaces of
  the aristocracy and were especially appreciated as litter-bearers.<a
  name="NtA5_8" href="#Nt5_8"><sup>[8]</sup></a> The imperial and municipal
  administrations, as well as the big contractors to whom customs and the
  mines were farmed out, hired or bought them in large numbers, and even in
  the remotest border provinces the <i>Syrus</i> was found serving princes,
  cities or private individuals. The worship of the Syrian goddess profited
  considerably by the economic current that continually brought new
  worshipers. We find her mentioned in the first century of our era in a
  Roman inscription referring in precise terms to the slave market, and we
  know that Nero took a devout fancy to the stranger that did not, however,
  last very long.<a name="NtA5_9" href="#Nt5_9"><sup>[9]</sup></a> In the
  popular Trastevere quarter she had a temple until the end of paganism.<a
  name="NtA5_10" href="#Nt5_10"><sup>[10]</sup></a> <!-- Page 107 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page107"></a>[107]</span></p>

  <p>During the imperial period, however, the slaves were no longer the
  only missionaries that came from Syria, and Atargatis was no longer the
  only divinity from that country to be worshiped in the Occident. The
  propagation of the Semitic worship progressed for the most part in a
  different manner under the empire.</p>

  <p>At the beginning of our era the Syrian merchants, <i>Syri
  negotiatores</i>, undertook a veritable colonization of the Latin
  provinces.<a name="NtA5_11" href="#Nt5_11"><sup>[11]</sup></a> During the
  second century before Christ the traders of that nation had established
  settlements along the coast of Asia Minor, on the Piraeus, and in the
  Archipelago. At Delos, a small island but a large commercial center, they
  maintained several associations that worshiped their national gods, in
  particular Hadad and Atargatis. But the wars that shook the Orient at the
  end of the republic, and above all the growth of piracy, ruined maritime
  commerce and stopped emigration. This began again with renewed vigor when
  the establishment of the empire guaranteed the safety of the seas and
  when the Levantine traffic attained a development previously unknown. We
  can trace the history of the Syrian establishments in the Latin provinces
  from the first to the seventh century, and recently we have begun to
  appreciate their economic, social and religious importance at its true
  value.</p>

  <p>The Syrians' love of lucre was proverbial. Active, compliant and able,
  frequently little scrupulous, they knew how to conclude first small
  deals, then larger ones, everywhere. Using the special talents of their
  race to advantage, they succeeded in establishing themselves on all
  coasts of the Mediterranean, even in <!-- Page 108 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page108"></a>[108]</span>Spain.<a name="NtA5_12"
  href="#Nt5_12"><sup>[12]</sup></a> At Malaga an inscription mentions a
  corporation formed by them. The Italian ports where business was
  especially active, Pozzuoli, Ostia, later Naples, attracted them in great
  numbers. But they did not confine themselves to the seashore; they
  penetrated far into the interior of the countries, wherever they hoped to
  find profitable trade. They followed the commercial highways and traveled
  up the big rivers. By way of the Danube they went as far as Pannonia, by
  way of the Rhone they reached Lyons. In Gaul they were especially
  numerous. In this new country that had just been opened to commerce
  fortunes could be made rapidly. A rescript discovered on the range of the
  Lebanon is addressed to sailors from Arles, who had charge of the
  transportation of grain, and in the department of Ain a bilingual epitaph
  has been found mentioning a merchant of the third century, Thaïm or
  Julian, son of Saad, decurion of the city of Canatha in Syria, who owned
  two factories in the Rhone basin, where he handled goods from
  Aquitania.<a name="NtA5_13" href="#Nt5_13"><sup>[13]</sup></a> Thus the
  Syrians spread over the entire province as far as Treves, where they had
  a strong colony. Not even the barbarian invasions of the fifth century
  stopped their immigration. Saint Jerome describes them traversing the
  entire Roman world amidst the troubles of the invasion, prompted by the
  lust of gain to defy all dangers. In the barbarian society the part
  played by this civilized and city-bred element was even more
  considerable. Under the Merovingians in about 591 they had sufficient
  influence at Paris to have one of their number elected bishop and to gain
  possession of all ecclesiastical offices. Gregory of Tours tells how King
  Gontrand, on entering the city of Orleans <!-- Page 109 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page109"></a>[109]</span>in 585, was received by
  a crowd praising him "in the language of the Latins, the Jews and the
  Syrians."<a name="NtA5_14" href="#Nt5_14"><sup>[14]</sup></a> The
  merchant colonies existed until the Saracen corsairs destroyed the
  commerce of the Mediterranean.</p>

  <p>Those establishments exercised a strong influence upon the economic
  and material life of the Latin provinces, especially in Gaul. As bankers
  the Syrians concentrated a large share of the money business in their
  hands and monopolized the importing of the valuable Levantine commodities
  as well as of the articles of luxury; they sold wines, spices, glassware,
  silks and purple fabrics, also objects wrought by goldsmiths, to be used
  as patterns by the native artisans. Their moral and religious influence
  was not less considerable: for instance, it has been shown that they
  furthered the development of monastic life during the Christian period,
  and that the devotion to the crucifix<a name="NtA5_15"
  href="#Nt5_15"><sup>[15]</sup></a> that grew up in opposition to the
  monophysites, was introduced into the Occident by them. During the first
  five centuries Christians felt an unconquerable repugnance to the
  representation of the Saviour of the world nailed to an instrument of
  punishment more infamous than the guillotine of to-day. The Syrians were
  the first to substitute reality in all its pathetic horror for a vague
  symbolism.</p>

  <p>In pagan times the religious ascendency of that immigrant population
  was no less remarkable. The merchants always took an interest in the
  affairs of heaven as well as in those of earth. At all times Syria was a
  land of ardent devotion, and in the first century its children were as
  fervid in propagating their barbarian gods in the Occident as after their
  conversion they were enthusiastic in spreading Christianity as far <!--
  Page 110 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page110"></a>[110]</span>as
  Turkestan and China. As soon as the merchants had established their
  places of business in the islands of the Archipelago during the
  Alexandrian period, and in the Latin period under the empire, they
  founded chapels in which they practised their exotic rites.</p>

  <p>It was easy for the divinities of the Ph&oelig;nician coast to cross
  the seas. Among them were Adonis, whom the women of Byblos mourned;
  Balmarcodes, "the Lord of the dances," who came from Beirut; Marna, the
  master of rain, worshiped at Gaza; and Maiuma,<a name="NtA5_16"
  href="#Nt5_16"><sup>[16]</sup></a> whose nautical holiday was celebrated
  every spring on the coast near Ostia as well as in the Orient.</p>

  <p>Besides these half Hellenized religions, others of a more purely
  Semitic nature came from the interior of the country, because the
  merchants frequently were natives of the cities of the <i>Hinterland</i>,
  as for instance Apamea or Epiphanea in Coele-Syria, or even of villages
  in that flat country. As Rome incorporated the small kingdoms beyond the
  Lebanon and the Orontes that had preserved a precarious independence, the
  current of emigration increased. In 71 Commagene, which lies between the
  Taurus and the Euphrates, was annexed by Vespasian, a little later the
  dynasties of Chalcis and Emesa were also deprived of their power. Nero,
  it appears, took possession of Damascus; half a century later Trajan
  established the new province of Arabia in the south (106 A.&nbsp;D.), and the
  oasis of Palmyra, a great mercantile center, lost its autonomy at the
  same time. In this manner Rome extended her direct authority as far as
  the desert, over countries that were only superficially Hellenized, and
  where the native devotions had preserved all their <!-- Page 111 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page111"></a>[111]</span>savage fervor. From
  that time constant communication was established between Italy and those
  regions which had heretofore been almost inaccessible. As roads were
  built commerce developed, and together with the interests of trade the
  needs of administration created an incessant exchange of men, of products
  and of beliefs between those out-of-the-way countries and the Latin
  provinces.</p>

  <p>These annexations, therefore, were followed by a renewed influx of
  Syrian divinities into the Occident. At Pozzuoli, the last port of call
  of the Levantine vessels, there was a temple to the Baal of Damascus
  (<i>Jupiter Damascenus</i>) in which leading citizens officiated, and
  there were altars on which two golden camels<a name="NtA5_17"
  href="#Nt5_17"><sup>[17]</sup></a> were offered to Dusares, a divinity
  who had come from the interior of Arabia. They kept company with a
  divinity of more ancient repute, the Hadad of Baabek-Heliopolis
  (<i>Jupiter Heliopolitanus</i>), whose immense temple, considered one of
  the world's wonders,<a name="NtA5_18" href="#Nt5_18"><sup>[18]</sup></a>
  had been restored by Antoninus Pius, and may still be seen facing Lebanon
  in majestic elegance. Heliopolis and Beirut had been the most ancient
  colonies founded by Augustus in Syria. The god of Heliopolis participated
  in the privileged position granted to the inhabitants of those two
  cities, who worshiped in a common devotion,<a name="NtA5_19"
  href="#Nt5_19"><sup>[19]</sup></a> and he was naturalized as a Roman with
  greater ease than the others.</p>

  <p>The conquest of all Syria as far as Euphrates and the subjection of
  even a part of Mesopotamia aided the diffusion of the Semitic religions
  in still another manner. From these regions, which were partly inhabited
  by fighting races, the Cæsars drew recruits for the imperial army. They
  levied a great number of <!-- Page 112 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page112"></a>[112]</span>legionaries, but especially auxiliary
  troops, who were transferred to the frontiers. Troopers and foot-soldiers
  from those provinces furnished important contingents to the garrisons of
  Europe and Africa. For instance, a cohort of one thousand archers from
  Emesa was established in Pannonia, another of archers from Damascus in
  upper Germany; Mauretania received irregulars from Palmyra, and bodies of
  troops levied in Ituraea, on the outskirts of the Arabian desert, were
  encamped in Dacia, Germany, Egypt and Cappadocia at the same time.
  Commagene alone furnished no less than six cohorts of five hundred men
  each that were sent to the Danube and into Numidia.<a name="NtA5_20"
  href="#Nt5_20"><sup>[20]</sup></a></p>

  <p>The number of inscriptions consecrated by soldiers proves both the
  ardor of their faith and the diversity of their beliefs. Like the sailors
  of to-day who are transferred to strange climes and exposed to incessant
  danger, they were constantly inclined to invoke the protection of heaven,
  and remained attached to the gods who seemed to remind them in their
  exile of the distant home country. Therefore it is not surprising that
  the Syrians who served in the army should have practised the religion of
  their Baals in the neighborhood of their camps. In the north of England,
  near the wall of Hadrian, an inscription in verse in honor of the goddess
  of Hierapolis has been found; its author was a prefect, probably of a
  cohort of Hamites stationed at this distant post.<a name="NtA5_21"
  href="#Nt5_21"><sup>[21]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Not all the soldiers, however, went to swell the ranks of believers
  worshiping divinities that had long been adopted by the Latin world, as
  did that officer. They also brought along new ones that had come from a
  still greater distance than their predecessors, in fact <!-- Page 113
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page113"></a>[113]</span>from the
  outskirts of the barbarian world, because from those regions in
  particular trained men could be obtained. There were, for instance,
  <i>Baltis</i>, an "Our Lady" from Osroene beyond the Euphrates;<a
  name="NtA5_22" href="#Nt5_22"><sup>[22]</sup></a> <i>Aziz</i>, the
  "strong god" of Edessa, who was identified with the star Lucifer;<a
  name="NtA5_23" href="#Nt5_23"><sup>[23]</sup></a> <i>Malakbel</i>, the
  "Lord's messenger," patron of the soldiers from Palmyra, who appeared
  with several companions at Rome, in Numidia and in Dacia.<a
  name="NtA5_24" href="#Nt5_24"><sup>[24]</sup></a> The most celebrated of
  those gods then was the Jupiter of Doliche, a small city of Commagene,
  that owed its fame to him. Because of the troops coming from that region,
  this obscure Baal, whose name is mentioned by no author, found worshipers
  in every Roman province as far as Africa, Germany and Brittany. The
  number of known inscriptions consecrated to him exceeds a hundred, and it
  is still growing. Being originally nothing but a god of lightning,
  represented as brandishing an ax, this local genius of the tempest was
  elevated to the rank of tutelary divinity of the imperial armies.<a
  name="NtA5_25" href="#Nt5_25"><sup>[25]</sup></a></p>

  <p>The diffusion of the Semitic religions in Italy that commenced
  imperceptibly under the republic became more marked after the first
  century of our era. Their expansion and multiplication were rapid, and
  they attained the apogee of their power during the third century. Their
  influence became almost predominant when the accession of the Severi lent
  them the support of a court that was half Syrian. Functionaries of all
  kinds, senators and officers, vied with each other in devotion to the
  patron gods of their sovereigns, gods which the sovereigns patronized in
  turn. Intelligent and ambitious princesses like Julia Domna, Julia Maesa,
  Julia Mammea, whose ascendency was very <!-- Page 114 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page114"></a>[114]</span>considerable, became
  propagators of their national religion. We all know the audacious
  pronunciamento of the year 218 that placed upon the throne the
  fourteen-year-old emperor Heliogabalus, a worshiper of the Baal of Emesa.
  His intention was to give supremacy over all other gods to his barbarian
  divinity, who had heretofore been almost unknown. The ancient authors
  narrate with indignation how this crowned priest attempted to elevate his
  black stone, the coarse idol brought from Emesa, to the rank of supreme
  divinity of the empire by subordinating the whole ancient pantheon to it;
  they never tire of giving revolting details about the dissoluteness of
  the debaucheries for which the festivities of the new <i>Sol invictus
  Elagabal</i> furnished a pretext.<a name="NtA5_26"
  href="#Nt5_26"><sup>[26]</sup></a> However, the question arises whether
  the Roman historians, being very hostile to that foreigner who haughtily
  favored the customs of his own country, did not misrepresent or partly
  misunderstand the facts. Heliogabalus's attempt to have his god
  recognized as supreme, and to establish a kind of monotheism in heaven as
  there was monarchy on earth, was undoubtedly too violent, awkward and
  premature, but it was in keeping with the aspirations of the time, and it
  must be remembered that the imperial policy could find the support of
  powerful Syrian colonies not only at Rome but all over the empire.</p>

  <p>Half a century later Aurelian<a name="NtA5_27"
  href="#Nt5_27"><sup>[27]</sup></a> was inspired by the same idea when he
  created a new worship, that of the "Invincible Sun." Worshiped in a
  splendid temple, by pontiffs equal in rank to those of ancient Rome,
  having magnificent plays held in his honor every fourth year, <i>Sol
  invictus</i> was also elevated to the supreme rank in the divine
  hierarchy, and became the special <!-- Page 115 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page115"></a>[115]</span>protector of the
  emperors and the empire. The country where Aurelian found the pattern he
  sought to reproduce, was again Syria. Into the new sanctuary he
  transferred the images of Bel and Helios, taken from Palmyra, after it
  had fallen before his arms.</p>

<hr class="short" >

  <p>The sovereigns, then, twice attempted to replace the Capitoline
  Jupiter by a Semitic god and to make a Semitic religion the principal and
  official religion of the Romans. They proclaimed the fall of the old
  Latin idolatry and the accession of a new paganism taken from Syria. What
  was the superiority attributed to the creeds of that country? Why did
  even an Illyrian general like Aurelian look for the most perfect type of
  pagan religion in that country? That is the problem to be solved, but it
  must remain unsolved unless an exact account is given of the fate of the
  Syrian beliefs under the empire.</p>

  <p>That question has not as yet been very completely elucidated. Besides
  the superficial opuscule of Lucian on the <i>dea Syria</i>, we find
  scarcely any reliable information in the Greek or Latin writers. The work
  by Philo of Byblos is a euhemeristic interpretation of an alleged
  Ph&oelig;nician cosmogony, and a composition of little merit. Neither
  have we the original texts of the Semitic liturgies, as we have for
  Egypt. Whatever we have learned we owe especially to the inscriptions,
  and while these furnish highly valuable indications as to the date and
  area of expansion of these religions, they tell us hardly anything about
  their doctrines. Light on this subject may be expected from the
  excavations that are being made in the great sanctuaries of Syria, and
  also from a more exact interpretation <!-- Page 116 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page116"></a>[116]</span>of the sculptured
  monuments that we now possess in great numbers, especially those of
  Jupiter Dolichenus.</p>

  <p>Some characteristics of the Semitic paganism, however, are known at
  present, and it must be admitted that it would appear at a disadvantage
  if judged by those noticeable features that first attract our attention.
  It had retained a stock of very primitive ideas and some aboriginal
  nature worship that had lasted through many centuries and was to persist,
  in part, under Christianity and Islam until the present day.<a
  name="NtA5_28" href="#Nt5_28"><sup>[28]</sup></a> Such were the worship
  of high elevations on which a rustic enclosure sometimes marked the
  limits of the consecrated territory; the worship of the waters that flow
  to the sea, the streams that arise in the mountains, the springs that
  gush out of the soil, the ponds, the lakes and the wells, into all of
  which offerings were thrown with the idea either of venerating in them
  the thirst-quenching liquid or else the fecund nature of the earth; the
  worship of the trees that shaded the altars and that nobody dared to fell
  or mutilate; the worship of stones, especially of the rough stones called
  bethels that were regarded, as their name (<i>beth-El</i>) indicates, as
  the residence of the god, or rather, as the matter in which the god was
  embodied.<a name="NtA5_29" href="#Nt5_29"><sup>[29]</sup></a> Aphrodite
  Astarte was worshiped in the shape of a conical stone at Paphos, and a
  black aerolite covered with projections and depressions to which a
  symbolic meaning was attributed represented Elagabal, and was transferred
  from Emesa to Rome, as we have said.</p>

  <p>The animals, as well as inanimate things, received their share of
  homage. Remnants of the old Semitic zoolatry perpetuated themselves until
  the end of paganism and even later. Frequently the gods were <!-- Page
  117 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page117"></a>[117]</span>represented standing erect on animals.
  Thus the Dolichean Baal stood on a steer, and his spouse on a lion.
  Around certain temples there were sacred parks, in which savage beasts
  roamed at liberty,<a name="NtA5_30" href="#Nt5_30"><sup>[30]</sup></a> a
  reminder of the time when they were considered divine. Two animals
  especially were the objects of universal veneration, the pigeon and the
  fish. Vagrant multitudes of pigeons received the traveler landing at
  Ascalon,<a name="NtA5_31" href="#Nt5_31"><sup>[31]</sup></a> and they
  played about the enclosures of all the temples of Astarte<a
  name="NtA5_32" href="#Nt5_32"><sup>[32]</sup></a> in flocks resembling
  white whirlwinds. The pigeon belonged, properly speaking, to the goddess
  of love, whose symbol it has remained above all to the people worshiping
  that goddess.</p>

      <p>Alba Palaestino sancta columba Syro?"<a name="NtA5_33" href="#Nt5_33"><sup>[33]</sup></a></p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>The fish was sacred to Atargatis, who undoubtedly had been represented
  in that shape at first, as Dagon always was.<a name="NtA5_34"
  href="#Nt5_34"><sup>[34]</sup></a> The fish were kept in ponds in the
  proximity of the temples.<a name="NtA5_35"
  href="#Nt5_35"><sup>[35]</sup></a> A superstitious fear prevented people
  from touching them, because the goddess punished the sacrilegious by
  covering their bodies with ulcers and tumors.<a name="NtA5_36"
  href="#Nt5_36"><sup>[36]</sup></a> At certain mystic repasts, however,
  the priests and initiates consumed the forbidden food in the belief that
  they were absorbing the flesh of the divinity herself. That worship and
  its practices, which were spread over Syria, probably suggested the
  ichthus symbolism in the Christian period.<a name="NtA5_37"
  href="#Nt5_37"><sup>[37]</sup></a></p>

  <p>However, over this lower and primordial stratum that still cropped out
  here and there, other less rudimentary beliefs had formed. Besides
  inanimate objects and animals, the Syrian paganism worshiped personal
  divinities especially. The character of the gods that were originally
  adored by the Semitic tribes has been <!-- Page 118 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page118"></a>[118]</span>ingeniously
  reconstructed.<a name="NtA5_38" href="#Nt5_38"><sup>[38]</sup></a> Each
  tribe had its Baal and Baalat who protected it and whom only its members
  were permitted to worship. The name of <i>Ba&lsquo;al</i>, "master,"
  summarizes the conception people had of him. In the first place he was
  regarded as the sovereign of his votaries, and his position in regard to
  them was that of an Oriental potentate towards his subjects; they were
  his servants, or rather his slaves.<a name="NtA5_39"
  href="#Nt5_39"><sup>[39]</sup></a> The Baal was at the same time the
  "master" or proprietor of the country in which he resided and which he
  made fertile by causing springs to gush from its soil. Or his domain was
  the firmament and he was the <i>dominus caeli</i>, whence he made the
  waters fall to the roar of tempests. He was always united with a
  celestial or earthly "queen" and, in the third place, he was the "lord"
  or husband of the "lady" associated with him. The one represented the
  male, the other the female principle; they were the authors of all
  fecundity, and as a consequence the worship of the divine couple often
  assumed a sensual and voluptuous character.</p>

  <p>As a matter of fact, immorality was nowhere so flagrant as in the
  temples of Astarte, whose female servants honored the goddess with
  untiring ardor. In no country was sacred prostitution so developed as in
  Syria, and in the Occident it was to be found practically only where the
  Ph&oelig;nicians had imported it, as on Mount Eryx. Those aberrations,
  that were kept up until the end of paganism,<a name="NtA5_40"
  href="#Nt5_40"><sup>[40]</sup></a> probably have their explanation in the
  primitive constitution of the Semitic tribe, and the religious custom
  must have been originally one of the forms of exogamy, which compelled
  the woman to unite herself first with a stranger.<a name="NtA5_41"
  href="#Nt5_41"><sup>[41]</sup></a> <!-- Page 119 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page119"></a>[119]</span></p>

  <p>As a second blemish, the Semitic religions practised human immolations
  longer than any other religion, sacrificing children and grown men in
  order to please sanguinary gods. In spite of Hadrian's prohibition of
  those murderous offerings,<a name="NtA5_42"
  href="#Nt5_42"><sup>[42]</sup></a> they were maintained in certain
  clandestine rites and in the lowest practices of magic, up to the fall of
  the idols, and even later. They corresponded to the ideas of a period
  during which the life of a captive or slave had no greater value than
  that of an animal.</p>

  <p>These sacred practices and many others, on which Lucian complacently
  enlarges in his opuscule on the goddess of Hierapolis, daily revived the
  habits of a barbarous past in the temples of Syria. Of all the
  conceptions that had successively dominated the country, none had
  completely disappeared. As in Egypt, beliefs of very different date and
  origin coexisted, without any attempt to make them agree, or without
  success when the task was undertaken. In these beliefs zoolatry,
  litholatry and all the other nature worships outlived the savagery that
  had created them. More than anywhere else the gods had remained the
  chieftains of clans<a name="NtA5_43" href="#Nt5_43"><sup>[43]</sup></a>
  because the tribal organizations of Syria were longer lived and more
  developed than those of any other region. Under the empire many districts
  were still subjected to the tribal régime and commanded by "ethnarchs" or
  "phylarchs."<a name="NtA5_44" href="#Nt5_44"><sup>[44]</sup></a>
  Religion, which sacrificed the lives of the men and the honor of the
  women to the divinity, had in many regards remained on the moral level of
  unsocial and sanguinary tribes. Its obscene and atrocious rites called
  forth exasperated indignation on the part of <!-- Page 120 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page120"></a>[120]</span>the Roman conscience
  when Heliogabalus attempted to introduce them into Italy with his Baal of
  Emesa.</p>

<hr class="short" >

  <p>How, then, can one explain the fact that in spite of all, the Syrian
  gods imposed themselves upon the Occident and made even the Cæsars accept
  them? The reason is that the Semitic paganism can no more be judged by
  certain revolting practices, that perpetuated in the heart of
  civilization the barbarity and puerilities of an uncultivated society,
  than the religion of the Nile can be so judged. As in the case of Egypt
  we must distinguish between the sacerdotal religion and the infinitely
  varied popular religion that was embodied in local customs. Syria
  possessed a number of great sanctuaries in which an educated clergy
  meditated and expatiated upon the nature of the divine beings and on the
  meaning of traditions inherited from remote ancestors. As their own
  interests demanded, that clergy constantly amended the sacred traditions
  and modified their spirit when the letter was immutable, in order to make
  them agree with the new aspirations of a more advanced period. They had
  their mysteries and their initiates to whom they revealed a wisdom that
  was above the vulgar beliefs of the masses.<a name="NtA5_45"
  href="#Nt5_45"><sup>[45]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Frequently we can draw diametrically opposite conclusions from the
  same principle. In that manner the old idea of <i>tabu</i>, that seems to
  have transformed the temples of Astarte into houses of debauchery, also
  became the source of a severe code of morals. The Semitic tribes were
  haunted with the fear of the tabu. A multitude of things were either
  impure or sacred because, in the original confusion, those two notions
  <!-- Page 121 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page121"></a>[121]</span>had not been clearly differentiated. Man's
  ability to use the products of nature to satisfy his needs, was thus
  limited by a number of prohibitions, restrictions and conditions. He who
  touched a forbidden object was soiled and corrupted, his fellows did not
  associate with him and he could no longer participate in the sacrifices.
  In order to wipe out the blemish, he had recourse to ablutions and other
  ceremonies known to the priests. Purity, that had originally been
  considered simply physical, soon became ritualistic and finally
  spiritual. Life was surrounded by a network of circumstances subject to
  certain conditions, every violation of which meant a fall and demanded
  penance. The anxiety to remain constantly in a state of holiness or
  regain that state when it had been lost, filled one's entire existence.
  It was not peculiar to the Semitic tribes, but they ascribed a prime
  importance to it.<a name="NtA5_46" href="#Nt5_46"><sup>[46]</sup></a> And
  the gods, who necessarily possessed this quality in an eminent degree,
  were holy beings (<span title="hagioi" class="grk"
  >&#x1F05;&gamma;&iota;&omicron;&iota;</span>)<a name="NtA5_47"
  href="#Nt5_47"><sup>[47]</sup></a> <i>par excellence</i>.</p>

  <p>In this way principles of conduct and dogmas of faith have frequently
  been derived from instinctive and absurd old beliefs. All theological
  doctrines that were accepted in Syria modified the prevailing ancient
  conception of the Baals. But in our present state of knowledge it is very
  difficult indeed to determine the shares that the various influences
  contributed, from the conquests of Alexander to the Roman domination, to
  make the Syrian paganism what it became under the Cæsars. The
  civilization of the Seleucid empire is little known, and we cannot
  determine what caused the alliance of Greek thought with the Semitic
  traditions.<a name="NtA5_48" href="#Nt5_48"><sup>[48]</sup></a> The
  religions of the neighboring nations <!-- Page 122 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page122"></a>[122]</span>also had an undeniable
  influence. Ph&oelig;nicia and Lebanon remained moral tributaries of Egypt
  long after they had liberated themselves from the suzerainty of the
  Pharaohs. The theogony of Philo of Byblos took gods and myths from that
  country, and at Heliopolis Hadad was honored "according to Egyptian
  rather than Syrian rite."<a name="NtA5_49"
  href="#Nt5_49"><sup>[49]</sup></a> The rigorous monotheism of the Jews,
  who were dispersed over the entire country, must also have acted as an
  active ferment of transformation.<a name="NtA5_50"
  href="#Nt5_50"><sup>[50]</sup></a> But it was Babylon that retained the
  intellectual supremacy, even after its political ruin. The powerful
  sacerdotal caste ruling it did not fall with the independence of the
  country, and it survived the conquests of Alexander as it had previously
  lived through the Persian domination. The researches of Assyriologists
  have shown that its ancient worship persisted under the Seleucides, and
  at the time of Strabo the "Chaldeans" still discussed cosmology and first
  principles in the rival schools of Borsippa and Orchoë.<a name="NtA5_51"
  href="#Nt5_51"><sup>[51]</sup></a> The ascendancy of that erudite clergy
  affected all surrounding regions; it was felt by Persia in the east,
  Cappadocia in the north, but more than anywhere else by the Syrians, who
  were connected with the Oriental Semites by bonds of language and blood.
  Even after the Parthians had wrested the valley of the Euphrates from the
  Seleucides, relations with the great temples of that region remained
  uninterrupted. The plains of Mesopotamia, inhabited by races of like
  origin, extended on both sides of an artificial border line; great
  commercial roads followed the course of the two rivers flowing into the
  Persian Gulf or cut across the desert, and the pilgrims came to Babylon,
  as Lucian tells us, to perform their devotions to the Lady of Bambyce.<a
  name="NtA5_52" href="#Nt5_52"><sup>[52]</sup></a> <!-- Page 123 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page123"></a>[123]</span></p>

  <p>Ever since the Captivity, constant spiritual relations had existed
  between Judaism and the great religious metropolis. At the birth of
  Christianity they manifested themselves in the rise of gnostic sects in
  which the Semitic mythology formed strange combinations with Jewish and
  Greek ideas and furnished the foundation for extravagant
  superstructures.<a name="NtA5_53" href="#Nt5_53"><sup>[53]</sup></a>
  Finally, during the decline of the empire, it was Babylon again from
  which emanated Manicheism, the last form of idolatry received in the
  Latin world. We can imagine how powerful the religious influence of that
  country on the Syrian paganism must have been.</p>

  <p>That influence manifested itself in various ways. First, it introduced
  new gods. In this way Bel passed from the Babylonian pantheon into that
  of Palmyra and was honored throughout northern Syria.<a name="NtA5_54"
  href="#Nt5_54"><sup>[54]</sup></a> It also caused ancient divinities to
  be arranged in new groups. To the primitive couple of the Baal and the
  Baalat a third member was added in order to form one of those triads
  dears to Chaldean theology. This took place at Hierapolis as well as at
  Heliopolis, and the three gods of the latter city, Hadad, Atargatis and
  Simios, became Jupiter, Venus and Mercury in Latin inscriptions.<a
  name="NtA5_55" href="#Nt5_55"><sup>[55]</sup></a> Finally, and most
  important, astrolatry wrought radical changes in the characters of the
  celestial powers, and, as a further consequence, in the entire Roman
  paganism. In the first place it gave them a second personality in
  addition to their own nature. The sidereal myths superimposed themselves
  upon the agrarian myths, and gradually obliterated them. Astrology, born
  on the banks of the Euphrates, imposed itself in Egypt upon the haughty
  and unapproachable clergy of the most conservative of all nations.<a
  name="NtA5_56" href="#Nt5_56"><sup>[56]</sup></a> Syria <!-- Page 124
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page124"></a>[124]</span>received it
  without reserve and surrendered unconditionally;<a name="NtA5_57"
  href="#Nt5_57"><sup>[57]</sup></a> numismatics and archeology as well as
  literature prove this. King Antiochus of Commagene, for instance, who
  died 34 B.&nbsp;C., built himself a monumental tomb on a spur of the Taurus,
  in which he placed his horoscope, designed on a large bas-relief, beside
  the images of his ancestral divinities.<a name="NtA5_58"
  href="#Nt5_58"><sup>[58]</sup></a></p>

  <p>The importance which the introduction of the Syrian religions into the
  Occident has for us consists therefore in the fact that indirectly they
  brought certain theological doctrines of the Chaldeans with them, just as
  Isis and Serapis carried beliefs of old Egypt from Alexandria to the
  Occident. The Roman empire received successively the religious tribute of
  the two great nations that had formerly ruled the Oriental world. It is
  characteristic that the god Bel whom Aurelian brought from Asia to set up
  as the protector of his states, was in reality a Babylonian who had
  emigrated to Palmyra,<a name="NtA5_59" href="#Nt5_59"><sup>[59]</sup></a>
  a cosmopolitan center apparently predestined by virtue of its location to
  become the intermediary between the civilizations of the Euphrates and
  the Mediterranean.</p>

  <p>The influence exercised by the speculations of the Chaldeans upon
  Greco-Roman thought can be asserted positively, but cannot as yet be
  strictly defined. It was at once philosophic and religious, literary and
  popular. The entire neo-Platonist school used the names of those
  venerable masters, but it cannot be determined how much it really owes to
  them. A selection of poems that has often been quoted since the third
  century, under the title of "Chaldaic Oracles" <span class="extra"
  title="moved from footnote">(<span title="Logia Chalda'ika"
  class="grk">&Lambda;&#x1F79;&gamma;&iota;&alpha;
  &Chi;&alpha;&lambda;&delta;&alpha;&#x3CA;&kappa;&#x1F71;</span>)</span>
  combines the ancient Hellenic theories with a fantastic <!-- Page 125
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page125"></a>[125]</span>mysticism that
  was certainly imported from the Orient. It is to Babylonia what the
  literature of Hermes Trismegistus is to Egypt, and it is equally
  difficult to determine the nature of the ingredients that the author put
  into his sacred compositions. But at an earlier date the Syrian religions
  had spread far and wide in the Occident ideas conceived on the distant
  banks of the Euphrates. I shall try to indicate briefly what their share
  in the pagan syncretism was.</p>

  <p>We have seen that the gods from Alexandria gained souls especially by
  the promise of blessed immortality. Those from Syria must also have
  satisfied doubts tormenting all the minds of that time. As a matter of
  fact the old Semitic ideas on man's fate in after-life were little
  comforting. We know how sad, dull and hopeless their conception of life
  after death was. The dead descended into a subterranean realm where they
  led a miserable existence, a weak reflection of the one they had lost;
  since they were subject to wants and suffering, they had to be supported
  by funeral offerings placed on their sepulchers by their descendants.
  Those ancient beliefs and customs were found also in primitive Greece and
  Italy.</p>

  <p>This rudimentary eschatology, however, gave way to quite a different
  conception, one that was closely related to the Chaldean astrology, and
  which spread over the Occident towards the end of the republic. According
  to this doctrine the soul returned to heaven after death, to live there
  among the divine stars. While it remained on earth it was subject to all
  the bitter necessities of a destiny determined by the revolutions of the
  stars; but when it ascended into the upper regions, it escaped that fate
  and even the limits of time; <!-- Page 126 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page126"></a>[126]</span>it shared equally in the immortality of
  the sidereal gods that surrounded it.<a name="NtA5_60"
  href="#Nt5_60"><sup>[60]</sup></a> In the opinion of some, the soul was
  attracted by the rays of the sun, and after passing through the moon,
  where it was purified, it lost itself in the shining star of day.<a
  name="NtA5_61" href="#Nt5_61"><sup>[61]</sup></a> Another more purely
  astrological theory, that was undoubtedly a development of the former,
  taught that the soul descended to earth from the heights of heaven by
  passing through the spheres of the seven planets. During its passage it
  acquired the dispositions and qualities proper to each planet. After
  death it returned to its original abode by the same route. To get from
  one sphere to another, it had to pass a door guarded by a commandant
  <span class="extra" title="moved from footnote">(<span title="archôn"
  class="grk">&#x1F04;&rho;&chi;&omega;&nu;</span>)</span>.<a
  name="NtA5_62" href="#Nt5_62"><sup>[62]</sup></a> Only the souls of
  initiates knew the password that made those incorruptible guardians
  yield, and under the conduct of a psychopompus<a name="NtA5_63"
  href="#Nt5_63"><sup>[63]</sup></a> they ascended safely from zone to
  zone. As the soul rose it divested itself of the passions and qualities
  it had acquired on its descent to the earth as though they were garments,
  and, free from sensuality, it penetrated into the eighth heaven to enjoy
  everlasting happiness as a subtle essence.</p>

  <p>Perhaps this doctrine, undoubtedly of Babylonian origin, was not
  generally accepted by the Syrian religions, as it was by the mysteries of
  Mithra, but these religions, impregnated with astrology, certainly
  propagated the belief that the souls of those worshipers that had led
  pious lives were elevated to the heights of heaven, where an apotheosis
  made them the equals of the luminous gods.<a name="NtA5_64"
  href="#Nt5_64"><sup>[64]</sup></a> Under the empire this doctrine slowly
  supplanted all others; the Elysian fields, which the votaries of Isis and
  Serapis still located in <!-- Page 127 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page127"></a>[127]</span>the depths of the earth, were transferred
  into the ether bathing the fixed stars,<a name="NtA5_65"
  href="#Nt5_65"><sup>[65]</sup></a> and the underworld was thereafter
  reserved for the wicked who had not been allowed to pass through the
  celestial gates.</p>

  <p>The sublime regions occupied by the purified souls were also the abode
  of the supreme god.<a name="NtA5_66" href="#Nt5_66"><sup>[66]</sup></a>
  When it transformed the ideas on the destiny of man, astrology also
  modified those relating to the nature of the divinity. In this matter the
  Syrian religions were especially original; for even if the Alexandrian
  mysteries offered man just as comforting prospects of immortality as the
  eschatology of their rivals, they were backward in building up a
  commensurate theology. To the Semitic races belongs the honor of having
  reformed the ancient fetichism most thoroughly. Their base and narrow
  conceptions of early times to which we can trace their existence, broaden
  and rise until they form a kind of monotheism.</p>

  <p>As we have seen, the Syrian tribes worshiped a god of lightning,<a
  name="NtA5_67" href="#Nt5_67"><sup>[67]</sup></a> like all primitive
  races. That god opened the reservoirs of the firmament to let the rain

  always remained his emblem.<a name="NtA5_68"
  href="#Nt5_68"><sup>[68]</sup></a> When the progress of astronomy removed
  the constellations to incommensurable distances, the "Baal of the
  Heavens" (<i>Ba&lsquo;al &#x161;amîn</i>) had to grow in majesty.
  Undoubtedly at the time of the Achemenides, he was connected with the
  Ahura-Mazda of the Persians, the ancient god of the vault of heaven, who
  had become the highest physical and moral power, and this connection
  helped to transform the old genius of thunder.<a name="NtA5_69"
  href="#Nt5_69"><sup>[69]</sup></a> People continued to worship the
  material heaven in him; under the Romans he was still simply called <!--

  Jupiter" (<i>Jupiter Caelestis</i>, <span title="Zeus Ouranios" class="grk"

  name="NtA5_70" href="#Nt5_70"><sup>[70]</sup></a> but it was a heaven
  studied by a sacred science that venerated its harmonious mechanism. The
  Seleucides represented him on their coins with a crescent over his
  forehead and carrying a sun with seven rays, to symbolize the fact that
  he presided over the course of the stars;<a name="NtA5_71"
  href="#Nt5_71"><sup>[71]</sup></a> or else he was shown with the two
  Dioscuri at his side, heroes who enjoyed life and suffered death in turn,
  according to the Greek myth, and who had become the symbols of the two
  celestial hemispheres. Religious uranography placed the residence of the
  supreme divinity in the most elevated region of the world, fixing its
  abode in the zone most distant from the earth, above the planets and the
  fixed stars. This fact was intended to be expressed by the term Most-High
  <span class="extra" title="moved from footnote">(<span title="Hupsistos"
  class="grk">&#x1F5D;&psi;&iota;&sigma;&tau;&omicron;&sigmaf;</span>)</span>
  applied to the Syrian Baals as well as to Jehovah.<a name="NtA5_72"
  href="#Nt5_72"><sup>[72]</sup></a> According to this cosmic religion, the
  Most High resided in the immense orb that contained the spheres of all
  the stars and embraced the entire universe which was subject to his
  domination. The Latins translated the name of this "Hypsistos" by
  <i>Jupiter summus exsuperantissimus</i><a name="NtA5_73"
  href="#Nt5_73"><sup>[73]</sup></a> to indicate his preeminence over all
  divine beings.</p>

  <p>As a matter of fact, his power was infinite. The primary postulate of
  the Chaldean astrology was that all phenomena and events of this world
  were necessarily determined by sidereal influence. The changes of nature,
  as well as the dispositions of men, were controlled according to fate, by
  the divine energies that resided in the heavens. In other words, the gods
  were almighty; they were the masters of destiny that governed the
  universe absolutely. The notion of their <!-- Page 129 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page129"></a>[129]</span>omnipotence resulted
  from the development of the ancient autocracy with which the Baals were
  credited. As we have stated, they were conceived after the image of an
  Asiatic monarch, and the religious terminology was evidently intended to
  display the humility of their priests toward them. In Syria we find
  nothing analogous to what existed in Egypt, where the priest thought he
  could compel the gods to act, and even dared to threaten them.<a
  name="NtA5_74" href="#Nt5_74"><sup>[74]</sup></a> The distance separating
  the human and the divine always was much greater with the Semitic tribes,
  and all that astrology did was to emphasize the distance more strongly by
  giving it a doctrinal foundation and a scientific appearance. In the
  Latin world the Asiatic religions propagated the conception of the
  absolute and illimitable sovereignty of God over the earth. Apuleius
  calls the Syrian goddess <i>omnipotens et omniparens</i>, "mistress and
  mother of all things."<a name="NtA5_75"
  href="#Nt5_75"><sup>[75]</sup></a></p>

  <p>The observation of the starry skies, moreover, had led the Chaldeans
  to the notion of a divine eternity. The constancy of the sidereal
  revolutions inspired the conclusion as to their perpetuity. The stars
  follow their ever uncompleted courses unceasingly; as soon as the end of
  their journey is reached, they resume without stopping the road already
  covered, and the cycles of years in which their movements take place
  extend from the indefinite past into the indefinite future.<a
  name="NtA5_76" href="#Nt5_76"><sup>[76]</sup></a> Thus a clergy of
  astronomers necessarily conceived Baal, "Lord of the heavens," as the
  "Master of eternity" or "He whose name is praised through all eternity"<a
  name="NtA5_77" href="#Nt5_77"><sup>[77]</sup></a>&mdash;titles which
  constantly recur in Semitic inscriptions. The divine stars did not die,
  like Osiris or Attis; whenever they seemed to weaken, they were <!-- Page
  130 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page130"></a>[130]</span>born to a
  new life and always remained invincible (<i>invicti</i>).</p>

  <p>Together with the mysteries of the Syrian Baals, this theological
  notion penetrated into Occidental paganism.<a name="NtA5_78"
  href="#Nt5_78"><sup>[78]</sup></a> Whenever an inscription to a <i>deus
  aeternus</i> is found in the Latin provinces it refers to a Syrian
  sidereal god, and it is a remarkable fact that this epithet did not enter
  the ritual before the second century, at the time the worship of the god
  Heaven (<i>Caelus</i>)<a name="NtA5_79"
  href="#Nt5_79"><sup>[79]</sup></a> was propagated. That the philosophers
  had long before placed the first cause beyond the limits of time was of
  no consequence, for their theories had not penetrated into the popular
  consciousness nor modified the traditional formulary of the liturgies. To
  the people the divinities were beings more beautiful, more vigorous, and
  more powerful than man, but born like him, and exempt only from old age
  and death, the immortals of old Homer. The Syrian priests diffused the
  idea of a god without beginning and without end through the Roman world,
  and thus contributed, along lines parallel with the Jewish proselytism,
  to lend the authority of dogma to what had previously been only a
  metaphysical theory.</p>

  <p>The Baals were universal as well as eternal, and their power became
  limitless in regard to space as it had been in regard to time. These two
  principles were correlative. The title of "<i>mar&lsquo;olam</i>" which
  the Baals bore occasionally may be translated by "Lord of the universe,"
  or by "Lord of eternity," and efforts certainly have been made to claim
  the twofold quality for them.<a name="NtA5_80"
  href="#Nt5_80"><sup>[80]</sup></a> Peopled with divine constellations and
  traversed by planets assimilated to the inhabitants of Olympus, the
  heavens determined the destinies of the <!-- Page 131 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page131"></a>[131]</span>entire human race by
  their movements, and the whole earth was subject to the changes produced
  by their revolutions.<a name="NtA5_81" href="#Nt5_81"><sup>[81]</sup></a>
  Consequently the old <i>Ba&lsquo;al &#x161;amîn</i> was necessarily
  transformed into a universal power. Of course, even under the Cæsars
  there existed in Syria traces of a period when the local god was the
  fetich of a clan and could be worshiped by the members of that clan only,
  a period when strangers were admitted to his altars only after a ceremony
  of initiation, as brothers, or at least as guests and clients.<a
  name="NtA5_82" href="#Nt5_82"><sup>[82]</sup></a> But from the period
  when our knowledge of the history of the great divinities of Heliopolis
  or Hierapolis begins, these divinities were regarded as common to all
  Syrians, and crowds of pilgrims came from distant countries to obtain
  grace in the holy cities. As protectors of the entire human race the
  Baals gained proselytes in the Occident, and their temples witnessed
  gatherings of devotees of every race and nationality. In this respect the
  Baals were distinctly different from Jehovah.</p>

  <p>The essence of paganism implies that the nature of a divinity broadens
  as the number of its votaries increases. Everybody credits it with some
  new quality, and its character becomes more complex. As it gains in power
  it also has a tendency to dominate its companion gods and to concentrate
  their functions in itself. To escape this threatening absorption, these
  gods must be of a very sharply defined personality and of a very original
  character. The vague Semitic deities, however, were devoid of a
  well-defined individuality. We fail to find among them a well organized
  society of immortals, like that of the Greek Olympus where each divinity
  had its own features and its own particular <!-- Page 132 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page132"></a>[132]</span>life full of adventures
  and experiences, and each followed its special calling to the exclusion
  of all the others. One was a physician, another a poet, a third a
  shepherd, hunter or blacksmith. The Greek inscriptions found in Syria
  are, in this regard, eloquently concise.<a name="NtA5_83"
  href="#Nt5_83"><sup>[83]</sup></a> Usually they have the name of Zeus
  accompanied by some simple epithet: kurios (<span class="extra"
  title="moved from footnote"><span title="kurios"
  class="grk">&kappa;&#x1F7B;&rho;&iota;&omicron;&sigmaf;</span>,</span>
  Lord), <i>aniketos</i> (<span class="extra" title="moved from footnote"
  ><span title="anikêtos" class="grk"
  >&#x1F00;&nu;&#x1F77;&kappa;&eta;&tau;&omicron;&sigmaf;</span>,</span>
  invincible), <i>megistos</i> (<span class="extra" title="moved from footnote"
  ><span title="megistos" class="grk"
  >&mu;&#x1F73;&gamma;&iota;&sigma;&tau;&omicron;&sigmaf;</span>,</span>
  greatest). All these Baals seem to have been brothers. They were
  personalities of indeterminate outline and interchangeable powers and
  were readily confused.</p>

  <p>At the time the Romans came into contact with Syria, it had already
  passed through a period of syncretism similar to the one we can study
  with greater precision in the Latin world. The ancient exclusiveness and
  the national particularism had been overcome. The Baals of the great
  sanctuaries had enriched themselves with the virtues<a name="NtA5_84"
  href="#Nt5_84"><sup>[84]</sup></a> of their neighbors; then, always
  following the same process, they had taken certain features from foreign
  divinities brought over by the Greek conquerors. In that manner their
  characters had become indefinable, they performed incompatible functions
  and possessed irreconcilable attributes. An inscription found in
  Britain<a name="NtA5_85" href="#Nt5_85"><sup>[85]</sup></a> assimilates
  the Syrian goddess to Peace, Virtue, Ceres, Cybele, and even to the sign
  of the Virgin.</p>

  <p>In conformity with the law governing the development of paganism, the
  Semitic gods tended to become pantheistic because they comprehended all
  nature and were identified with it. The various deities were nothing but
  different aspects under which the supreme and infinite being manifested
  itself. Although Syria <!-- Page 133 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page133"></a>[133]</span>remained deeply and even coarsely
  idolatrous in practice, in theory it approached monotheism or, better
  perhaps, henotheism. By an absurd but curious etymology the name Hadad
  has been explained as "one, one" (<i>&lsquo;ad &lsquo;ad</i>).<a
  name="NtA5_86" href="#Nt5_86"><sup>[86]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Everywhere the narrow and divided polytheism showed a confused
  tendency to elevate itself into a superior synthesis, but in Syria
  astrology lent the firmness of intelligent conviction to notions that
  were vague elsewhere. The Chaldean cosmology, which deified all elements
  but ascribed a predominant influence to the stars, ruled the entire
  Syrian syncretism. It considered the world as a great organism which was
  kept intact by an intimate solidarity, and whose parts continually
  influenced each other.</p>

  <p>The ancient Semites believed therefore that the divinity could be
  regarded as embodied in the waters, in the fire of the lightning, in
  stones or plants. But the most powerful gods were the constellations and
  the planets that governed the course of time and of all things.</p>

  <p>The sun was supreme because it led the starry choir, because it was
  the king and guide of all the other luminaries and therefore the master
  of the whole world.<a name="NtA5_87" href="#Nt5_87"><sup>[87]</sup></a>
  The astronomical doctrines of the "Chaldeans" taught that this
  incandescent globe alternately attracted and repelled the other sidereal
  bodies, and from this principle the Oriental theologians had concluded
  that it must determine the entire life of the universe, inasmuch as it
  regulated the movements of the heavens. As the "intelligent light" it was
  especially the creator of human reason, and just as it repelled and
  attracted the planets in turn, it was believed <!-- Page 134 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page134"></a>[134]</span>to send out souls, at
  the time of birth, into the bodies they animated, and to cause them to
  return to its bosom after death by means of a series of emissions and
  absorptions.</p>

  <p>Later on, when the seat of the Most-High was placed beyond the limits
  of the universe, the radiant star that gives us light became the visible
  image of the supreme power, the source of all life and all intelligence,
  the intermediary between an inaccessible god and mankind, and the one
  object of special homage from the multitude.<a name="NtA5_88"
  href="#Nt5_88"><sup>[88]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Solar pantheism, which grew up among the Syrians of the Hellenistic
  period as a result of the influence of Chaldean astrolatry, imposed
  itself upon the whole Roman world under the empire. Our very rapid sketch
  of the constitution of that theological system shows incidentally the
  last form assumed by the pagan idea of God. In this matter Syria was
  Rome's teacher and predecessor. The last formula reached by the religion
  of the pagan Semites and in consequence by that of the Romans, was a
  divinity unique, almighty, eternal, universal and ineffable, that
  revealed itself throughout nature, but whose most splendid and most
  energetic manifestation was the sun. To arrive at the Christian
  monotheism<a name="NtA5_89" href="#Nt5_89"><sup>[89]</sup></a> only one
  final tie had to be broken, that is to say, this supreme being residing
  in a distant heaven had to be removed beyond the world. So we see once
  more in this instance, how the propagation of the Oriental cults levelled
  the roads for Christianity and heralded its triumph. Although astrology
  was always fought by the church, it had nevertheless prepared the minds
  for the dogmas the church was to proclaim.</p>

<h3>PERSIA.</h3>

  <p>The dominant historical fact in western Asia in ancient times was the
  opposition between the Greco-Roman and Persian civilizations, which was
  itself only an episode in the great struggle that was constantly in
  progress between the Orient and the Occident in those countries. In the
  first enthusiasm of their conquests, the Persians extended their dominion
  as far as the cities of Ionia and the islands of the Ægean Sea, but their
  power of expansion was broken at the foot of the Acropolis. One hundred
  and fifty years later, Alexander destroyed the empire of the Achemenides
  and carried Hellenic culture to the banks of the Indus. After two and a
  half centuries the Parthians under the Arsacid dynasty advanced to the
  borders of Syria, and Mithradates Eupator, an alleged descendant of
  Darius, penetrated to the heart of Greece at the head of his Persian
  nobility from Pontus.</p>

  <p>After the flood came the ebb. The reconstructed Roman empire of
  Augustus soon reduced Armenia, Cappadocia and even the kingdom of the
  Parthians to a kind of vassalage. But after the middle of the third
  century the Sassanid dynasty restored the power of Persia and revived its
  ancient pretensions. From that time until the triumph of Islam it was one
  long <!-- Page 136 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page136"></a>[136]</span>duel between the two rival states, in
  which now one was victorious and now the other, while neither was ever
  decisively beaten. An ambassador of king Narses to Galerius called these
  two states "the two eyes of the human race."<a name="NtA6_1"
  href="#Nt6_1"><sup>[1]</sup></a></p>

  <p>The "invincible" star of the Persians might wane and vanish, but only
  to reappear in greater glory. The political and military strength
  displayed by this nation through the centuries was the result of its high
  intellectual and moral qualities. Its original culture was always hostile
  to such an assimilation as that experienced in different degrees by the
  Aryans of Phrygia, the Semites of Syria and the <span class="correction"
  title="text reads `Hanites'">Hamites</span> of Egypt. Hellenism and
  Iranism&mdash;if I may use that term&mdash;were two equally noble
  adversaries but differently educated, and they always remained separated
  by instinctive racial hostility as much as by hereditary opposition of
  interests.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, when two civilizations are in contact for more than a
  thousand years, numerous exchanges are bound to occur. The influence
  exercised by Hellenism as far as the uplands of Central Asia has
  frequently been pointed out,<a name="NtA6_2"
  href="#Nt6_2"><sup>[2]</sup></a> but the prestige retained by Persia
  throughout the ages and the extent of area influenced by its energy has
  not perhaps been shown with as much accuracy. For even if Mazdaism was
  the highest expression of Persian genius and its influence in consequence
  mainly religious, yet it was not exclusively so.</p>

  <p>After the fall of the Achemenides the memory of their empire long
  haunted Alexander's successors. Not only did the dynasties which claimed
  to be descended from Darius, and which ruled over Pontus, <!-- Page 137
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page137"></a>[137]</span>Cappadocia and
  Commagene, cultivate political traditions that brought them nearer to
  their supposed ancestors, but those traditions were partly adopted even
  by the Seleucides and the Ptolemies, the legitimate heirs of the ancient
  masters of Asia. People were fond of recalling the ideals of past
  grandeur and sought to realize them in the present. In that manner
  several institutions were transmitted to the Roman emperors through the
  agency of the Asiatic monarchies. The institution of the <i>amici
  Augusti</i>, for instance, the appointed friends and intimate counselors
  of the rulers, adopted in Italy the forms in use at the court of the
  Diadochi, who had themselves imitated the ancient organization of the
  palace of the Great Kings.<a name="NtA6_3"
  href="#Nt6_3"><sup>[3]</sup></a></p>

  <p>The custom of carrying the sacred fire before the Cæsars as an emblem
  of the perpetuity of their power, dated back to Darius and with other
  Persian traditions passed on to the dynasties that divided the empire of
  Alexander. There is a striking similarity not only between the observance
  of the Cæsars and the practice of the Oriental monarchs, but also between
  the beliefs that they held. The continuity of the political and religious
  tradition cannot be doubted.<a name="NtA6_4"
  href="#Nt6_4"><sup>[4]</sup></a> As the court ceremonial and the internal
  history of the Hellenistic kingdoms become better known we shall be able
  to outline with greater precision the manner in which the divided and
  diminished heritage of the Achemenides, after generations of rulers, was
  finally left to those Occidental sovereigns who called themselves the
  sacrosanct lords of the world as Artaxerxes had done.<a name="NtA6_5"
  href="#Nt6_5"><sup>[5]</sup></a> It may not be generally known that the
  habit of welcoming friends with a kiss was a ceremony in the <!-- Page
  138 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page138"></a>[138]</span>Oriental
  formulary before it became a familiar custom in Europe.<a name="NtA6_6"
  href="#Nt6_6"><sup>[6]</sup></a></p>

  <p>It is very difficult to trace the hidden paths by which pure ideas
  travel from one people to another. But certain it is that at the
  beginning of our era certain Mazdean conceptions had already spread
  outside of Asia. The extent of the influence of Parseeism upon the
  beliefs of Israel under the Achemenides cannot be determined, but its
  existence is undeniable.<a name="NtA6_7" href="#Nt6_7"><sup>[7]</sup></a>
  Some of its doctrines, as for instance those relating to angels and
  demons, the end of the world and the final resurrection, were propagated
  everywhere in the basin of the Mediterranean as a consequence of the
  diffusion of Jewish colonies.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, ever since the conquests of Cyrus and Darius, the
  active attention of the Greeks had been drawn toward the doctrines and
  religious practices of the new masters of the Orient.<a name="NtA6_8"
  href="#Nt6_8"><sup>[8]</sup></a> A number of legends representing
  Pythagoras, Democritus and other philosophers as disciples of the magi
  prove the prestige of that powerful sacerdotal class. The Macedonian
  conquest, which placed the Greeks in direct relations with numerous
  votaries of Mazdaism, gave a new impetus to works treating that religion,
  and the great scientific movement inaugurated by Aristotle caused many
  scholars to look into the doctrines taught by the Persian subjects of the
  Seleucides. We know from a reliable source that the works catalogued
  under the name of Zoroaster in the library of Alexandria contained two
  million lines. This immense body of sacred literature was bound to
  attract the attention of scholars and to call forth the reflections of
  philosophers. The dim and dubious science that reached <!-- Page 139
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page139"></a>[139]</span>even the lower
  classes under the name of "magic" was to a considerable extent of Persian
  origin, as its name indicates, and along with physician's recipes and
  thaumaturgic processes it imparted some theological doctrines in a
  confused fashion.<a name="NtA6_9" href="#Nt6_9"><sup>[9]</sup></a></p>

  <p>This explains why certain institutions and beliefs of the Persians had
  found imitators and adepts in the Greco-Oriental world long before the
  Romans had gained a foothold in Asia. Their influence was indirect,
  secret, frequently indiscernible, but it was certain. The most active
  agencies in the diffusion of Mazdaism as of Judaism seem to have been
  colonies of believers who had emigrated far from the mother country.
  There was a Persian dispersion similar to that of the Israelites.
  Communities of magi were established not only in eastern Asia Minor, but
  in Galatia, Phrygia, Lydia and even in Egypt. Everywhere they remained
  attached to their customs and beliefs with persistent tenacity.<a
  name="NtA6_10" href="#Nt6_10"><sup>[10]</sup></a></p>

  <p>When Rome extended her conquests into Asia Minor and Mesopotamia, the
  influence of Persia became much more direct. Superficial contact with the
  Mazdean populations began with the wars against Mithradates, but it did
  not become frequent and lasting until the first century of our era.
  During that century the empire gradually extended its limits to the upper
  Euphrates, and thereby absorbed all the uplands of Anatolia and Commagene
  south of the Taurus. The native dynasties which had fostered the secular
  isolation of those distant countries in spite of the state of vassalage
  to which they had been reduced disappeared one after another. The
  Flavians constructed through those hitherto almost inaccessible regions
  an immense network <!-- Page 140 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page140"></a>[140]</span>of roads that were as important to Rome as
  the railways of Turkestan or of Siberia are to modern Russia. At the same
  time Roman legions camped on the banks of the Euphrates and in the
  mountains of Armenia. Thus all the little Mazdean centers scattered in
  Cappadocia and Pontus were forced into constant relation with the Latin
  world, and on the other hand the disappearance of the buffer states made
  the Roman and Parthian empires neighboring powers in Trajan's time
  (98-117 A.&nbsp;D.).</p>

  <p>From these conquests and annexations in Asia Minor and Syria dates the
  sudden propagation of the Persian mysteries of Mithra in the Occident.
  For even though a congregation of their votaries seems to have existed at
  Rome under Pompey as early as 67 B.&nbsp;C., the real diffusion of the
  mysteries began with the Flavians toward the end of the first century of
  our era. They became more and more prominent under the Antonines and the
  Severi, and remained the most important cult of paganism until the end of
  the fourth century. Through them as a medium the original doctrines of
  Mazdaism were widely propagated in every Latin province, and in order to
  appreciate the influence of Persia upon the Roman creeds, we must now
  give them our careful attention.</p>

  <p>However, it must be said that the growing influence of Persia did not
  manifest itself solely in the religious sphere. After the accession of
  the Sassanid dynasty (228 A.&nbsp;D.) the country once more became conscious
  of its originality, again resumed the cultivation of national traditions,
  reorganized the hierarchy of its official clergy and recovered the
  political cohesion which had been wanting under the Parthians. It felt
  <!-- Page 141 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page141"></a>[141]</span>and showed its superiority over the
  neighboring empire that was then torn by factions, thrown upon the mercy
  of manifestoes, and ruined economically and morally. The studies now
  being made in the history of that period show more and more that
  debilitated Rome had become the imitator of Persia.</p>

  <p>In the opinion of contemporaries the court of Diocletian, prostrating
  itself before a master who was regarded as the equal of God, with its
  complicated hierarchy and crowd of eunuchs that disgraced it, was an
  imitation of the court of the Sassanides. Galerius declared in
  unmistakable terms that Persian absolutism must be introduced in his
  empire,<a name="NtA6_11" href="#Nt6_11"><sup>[11]</sup></a> and the
  ancient Cæsarism founded on the will of the people seemed about to be
  transformed into a sort of caliphate.</p>

  <p>Recent discoveries also throw light upon a powerful artistic school
  that developed in the Parthian empire and later in that of the Sassanides
  and which grew up independently of the Greek centers of production. Even
  if it took certain models from the Hellenic sculpture or architecture, it
  combined them with Oriental motives into a decoration of exuberant
  richness. Its field of influence extended far beyond Mesopotamia into the
  south of Syria where it has left monuments of unequalled splendor. The
  radiance of that brilliant center undoubtedly illuminated Byzantium, the
  barbarians of the north, and even China.<a name="NtA6_12"
  href="#Nt6_12"><sup>[12]</sup></a></p>

  <p>The Persian Orient, then, exerted a dominant influence on the
  political institutions and artistic tastes of the Romans as well as on
  their ideas and beliefs. The propagation of the religion of Mithra, which
  always proudly proclaimed its Persian origin, was accompanied by a number
  of parallel influences of the <!-- Page 142 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page142"></a>[142]</span>people from which it had issued. Never,
  not even during the Mohammedan invasions, had Europe a narrower escape
  from becoming Asiatic than when Diocletian officially recognized Mithra
  as the protector of the reconstructed empire.<a name="NtA6_13"
  href="#Nt6_13"><sup>[13]</sup></a> The time when that god seemed to be
  establishing his authority over the entire civilized world was one of the
  critical phases in the moral history of antiquity. An irresistible
  invasion of Semitic and Mazdean conceptions nearly succeeded in
  permanently overwhelming the Occidental spirit. Even after Mithra had
  been vanquished and expelled from Christianized Rome, Persia did not
  disarm. The work of conversion in which Mithraism had failed was taken up
  by Manicheism, the heir to its cardinal doctrines, and until the Middle
  Ages Persian dualism continued to cause bloody struggles in the ancient
  Roman provinces.</p>

<hr class="short" >

  <p>Just as we cannot understand the character of the mysteries of Isis
  and Serapis without studying the circumstances accompanying their
  creation by the Ptolemies, so we cannot appreciate the causes of the
  power attained by the mysteries of Mithra, unless we go far back to their
  origin.</p>

  <p>Here the subject is unfortunately more obscure. The ancient authors
  tell us almost nothing about the origin of Mithra. One point on which
  they all agree is that he was a Persian god, but this we should know from
  the Avesta even if they had not mentioned it. But how did he get to Italy
  from the Persian uplands?</p>

  <p>Two scant lines of Plutarch are the most explicit document we have on
  the subject. He narrates incidentally that the pirates from Asia Minor
  vanquished <!-- Page 143 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page143"></a>[143]</span>by Pompey in 67 performed strange
  sacrifices on Olympus, a volcano of Lycia, and practiced occult rites,
  among others those of Mithra which, he says, "exist to the present day
  and were first taught by them."<a name="NtA6_14"
  href="#Nt6_14"><sup>[14]</sup></a> Lactantius Placidus, a commentator on
  Statius and a mediocre authority, also tells us that the cult passed from
  the Persians to the Phrygians and from the Phrygians to the Romans.<a
  name="NtA6_15" href="#Nt6_15"><sup>[15]</sup></a></p>

  <p>These two authors agree then in fixing in Asia Minor the origin of
  this Persian religion that later spread over the Occident, and in fact
  various indications direct us to that country. The frequency of the name
  Mithradates, for instance, in the dynasties of Pontus, Cappadocia,
  Armenia and Commagene, connected with the Achemenides by fictitious
  genealogies, shows the devotion of those kings to Mithra.</p>

  <p>As we see, the Mithraism that was revealed to the Romans at the time
  of Pompey had established itself in the Anatolian monarchies during the
  preceding period, which was an epoch of intense moral and religious
  unrest. Unfortunately we have no monuments of that period of its history.
  The absence of direct testimony on the development of Mazdean sects
  during the last three centuries before our era prevents us from gaining
  exact knowledge of the Parseeism of Asia Minor.</p>

  <p>None of the temples dedicated to Mithra in that religion have been
  examined.<a name="NtA6_16" href="#Nt6_16"><sup>[16]</sup></a> The
  inscriptions mentioning his name are as yet few and insignificant, so
  that it is only by indirect means that we can arrive at conclusions about
  this primitive cult. The only way to explain its distinguishing features
  in the Occident is to study the environment in which it originated.</p>

  <p>During the domination of the Achemenides eastern <!-- Page 144
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page144"></a>[144]</span>Asia Minor was
  colonized by the Persians. The uplands of Anatolia resembled those of
  Persia in climate and soil, and were especially adapted to the raising of
  horses.<a name="NtA6_17" href="#Nt6_17"><sup>[17]</sup></a> In Cappadocia
  and even in Pontus the aristocracy who owned the soil belonged to the
  conquering nation. Under the various governments which followed after the
  death of Alexander, those landlords remained the real masters of the
  country, chieftains of clans governing the canton where they had their
  domains, and, on the outskirts of Armenia at least, they retained the
  hereditary title of satraps through all political vicissitudes until the
  time of Justinian, thus recalling their Persian origin.<a name="NtA6_18"
  href="#Nt6_18"><sup>[18]</sup></a> This military and feudal aristocracy
  furnished Mithradates Eupator a considerable number of the officers who
  helped him in his long defiance of Rome, and later it defended the
  threatened independence of Armenia against the enterprises of the Cæsars.
  These warriors worshiped Mithra as the protecting genius of their arms,
  and this is the reason why Mithra always, even in the Latin world,
  remained the "invincible" god, the tutelary deity of armies, held in
  special honor by warriors.</p>

  <p>Besides the Persian nobility a Persian clergy had also become
  established in the peninsula. It officiated in famous temples, at Zela in
  Pontus and Hierocæsarea in Lydia. Magi, called <i>magousaioi</i> or
  <i>pyrethes</i> (firelighters) were scattered over the Levant. Like the
  Jews, they retained their national customs and traditional rites with
  such scrupulous loyalty that Bardesanes of Edessa cited them as an
  example in his attempt to refute the doctrines of astrology and to show
  that a nation can retain the same customs in different climates.<a
  name="NtA6_19" href="#Nt6_19"><sup>[19]</sup></a> We know their religion
  sufficiently to be <!-- Page 145 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page145"></a>[145]</span>certain that the Syrian author had good
  grounds for attributing that conservative spirit to them. The sacrifices
  of the <i>pyrethes</i> which Strabo observed in Cappadocia recall all the
  peculiarities of the Avestan liturgy. The same prayers were recited
  before the altar of the fire while the priest held the sacred fasces
  (<i>bareçman</i>); the same offerings were made of milk, oil and honey;
  and the same precautions were taken to prevent the priest's breath from
  polluting the divine flame. Their gods were practically those of orthodox
  Mazdaism. They worshiped Ahura Mazda, who had to them remained a divinity
  of the sky as Zeus and Jupiter had been originally. Below him they
  venerated deified abstractions (such as Vohumano, "good mind," and
  Ameretat, "immortality") from which the religion of Zoroaster made its
  Amshaspends, the archangels surrounding the Most High.<a name="NtA6_20"
  href="#Nt6_20"><sup>[20]</sup></a> Finally they sacrificed to the spirits
  of nature, the Yazatas: for instance, Anahita or Anaites the goddess of
  the waters&mdash;that made fertile the fields; Atar, the personification
  of fire; and especially Mithra, the pure genius of light.</p>

  <p>Thus the basis of the religion of the magi of Asia Minor was Mazdaism,
  somewhat changed from that of the Avesta, and in certain respects holding
  closer to the primitive nature worship of the Aryans, but nevertheless a
  clearly characterized and distinctive Mazdaism, which was to remain the
  most solid foundation for the greatness of the mysteries of Mithra in the
  Occident.</p>

  <p>Recent discoveries<a name="NtA6_21" href="#Nt6_21"><sup>[21]</sup></a>
  of bilingual inscriptions have succeeded in establishing the fact that
  the language used, or at least written, by the Persian colonies of Asia
  Minor was not their ancient Aryan idiom, but <!-- Page 146 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page146"></a>[146]</span>Aramaic, which was a
  Semitic dialect. Under the Achemenides this was the diplomatic and
  commercial language of all countries west of the Tigris. In Cappadocia
  and Armenia it remained the literary and probably also the liturgical
  language until it was slowly supplanted by Greek during the Hellenistic
  period. The very name <i>magousaioi</i> <span class="extra" title="moved from footnote"
  >(<span title="magousaioi" class="grk"
  >&mu;&alpha;&gamma;&omicron;&upsilon;&sigma;&alpha;&#x1FD6;&omicron;&iota;</span>)</span>
  given to the magi in those countries is an exact transcription of a
  Semitic plural.<a name="NtA6_22" href="#Nt6_22"><sup>[22]</sup></a> This
  phenomenon, surprising at first sight, is explained by the history of the
  <i>magousaioi</i> who emigrated to Asia Minor. They did not come there
  directly from Persepolis or Susa, but from Mesopotamia. Their religion
  had been deeply influenced by the speculations of the powerful clergy
  officiating in the temples of Babylon. The learned theology of the
  Chaldeans imposed itself on the primitive Mazdaism, which was a
  collection of traditions and rites rather than a body of doctrines. The
  divinities of the two religions became identified, their legends
  connected, and the Semitic astrology, the result of long continued
  scientific observations, superimposed itself on the naturalistic myths of
  the Persians. Ahura Mazda was assimilated to Bel, Anahita to Ishtar, and
  Mithra to Shamash, the solar god. For that reason Mithra was commonly
  called <i>Sol invictus</i> in the Roman mysteries, and an abstruse and a
  complicated astronomic symbolism was always part of the teachings
  revealed to candidates for initiation and manifested itself also in the
  artistic embellishments of the temple.</p>

  <p>In connection with a cult from Commagene we can observe rather closely
  how the fusion of Parseeism with Semitic and Anatolian creeds took place,
  because <!-- Page 147 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page147"></a>[147]</span>in those regions the form of religious
  transformations was at all times syncretic. On a mountain top in the
  vicinity of a town named Doliche, a deity was worshiped who after a
  number of transformations became a Jupiter Protector of the Roman armies.
  Originally this god, who was believed to have discovered the use of iron,
  seems to have been brought to Commagene by a tribe of blacksmiths, the
  Chalybes, who had come from the north.<a name="NtA6_23"
  href="#Nt6_23"><sup>[23]</sup></a> He was represented standing on a steer
  and holding in his hand a two-edged ax, an ancient symbol venerated in
  Crete during the Mycenean age and found also at Labranda in Caria and all
  over Asia Minor.<a name="NtA6_24" href="#Nt6_24"><sup>[24]</sup></a> The
  ax symbolized the god's mastery over the lightning which splits asunder
  the trees of the forest amidst the din of storms. Once established on
  Syrian soil, this genius of thunder became identified with some local
  Baal and his cult took up all the Semitic features. After the conquests
  of Cyrus and the founding of the Persian domination, this "Lord of the
  heavens" was readily confounded with Ahura Mazda, who was likewise "the
  full circle of heaven," according to a definition of Herodotus,<a
  name="NtA6_25" href="#Nt6_25"><sup>[25]</sup></a> and whom the Persians
  also worshiped on mountain tops. When a half Persian, half Hellenic
  dynasty succeeded Alexander in Commagene, this Baal became a <i>Zeus
  Oromasdes</i> (<span class="extra" title="moved from footnote"><span
  title="Zeus Ôromasdês" class="grk">&Zeta;&epsilon;&#x1FE6;&sigmaf;
  &#x1F68;&rho;&omicron;&mu;&#x1F71;&sigma;&delta;&eta;&sigmaf;</span>,</span>
  Ahura Mazda) residing in the sublime ethereal regions. A Greek
  inscription speaks of the celestial thrones "on which this supreme
  divinity receives the souls of its worshipers."<a name="NtA6_26"
  href="#Nt6_26"><sup>[26]</sup></a> In the Latin countries "Jupiter
  Caelus" remained at the head of the Mazdean pantheon,<a name="NtA6_27"
  href="#Nt6_27"><sup>[27]</sup></a> and in all the provinces the temples
  of <!-- Page 148 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page148"></a>[148]</span>"Jupiter Dolichenus" were erected beside
  those of Mithra, and the two remained in the closest relations.<a
  name="NtA6_28" href="#Nt6_28"><sup>[28]</sup></a></p>

  <p>The same series of transformations took place elsewhere with a number
  of other gods.<a name="NtA6_29" href="#Nt6_29"><sup>[29]</sup></a> The
  Mithra worship was thus formed, in the main, by a combination of Persian
  beliefs with Semitic theology, incidentally including certain elements
  from the native cults of Asia Minor. The Greeks later translated the
  names of the Persian divinities into their language and imposed certain
  forms of their mysteries on the Mazdean cult.<a name="NtA6_30"
  href="#Nt6_30"><sup>[30]</sup></a> Hellenic art lent to the Yazatas that
  idealized form in which it liked to represent the immortals, and
  philosophy, especially that of the Stoics, endeavored to discover its own
  physical and metaphysical theories in the traditions of the magi. But in
  spite of all these <span class="correction" title="text reads `accomodations'"
  >accommodations</span>, adaptations and interpretations, Mithraism always
  remained in substance a Mazdaism blended with Chaldeanism, that is to
  say, essentially a barbarian religion. It certainly was far less
  Hellenized than the Alexandrian cult of Isis and Serapis, or even that of
  the Great Mother of Pessinus. For that reason it always seemed
  unacceptable to the Greek world, from which it continued to be almost
  completely excluded. Even language furnishes a curious proof of that
  fact. Greek contains a number of theophorous (<span class="extra"
  title="moved from footnote"><span title="theophoros"
  class="grk">&theta;&epsilon;&omicron;&phi;&#x1F79;&rho;&omicron;&sigmaf;</span>,</span>
  god-bearing) names formed from those of Egyptian or Phrygian gods, like
  Serapion, Metrodoros, Metrophilos&mdash;Isidore is in use at the present
  day&mdash;but all known derivations of Mithra are of barbarian formation.
  The Greeks never admitted the god of their hereditary enemies, and the
  great centers of Hellenic <!-- Page 149 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page149"></a>[149]</span>civilization escaped his influence and he
  theirs.<a name="NtA6_31" href="#Nt6_31"><sup>[31]</sup></a> Mithraism
  passed directly from Asia into the Latin world.</p>

  <p>There it spread with lightning rapidity from the time it was first
  introduced. When the progressive march of the Romans toward the Euphrates
  enabled them to investigate the sacred trust transmitted by Persia to the
  magi of Asia Minor, and when they became acquainted with the Mazdean
  beliefs which had matured in the seclusion of the Anatolian mountains,
  they adopted them with enthusiasm. The Persian cult was spread by the
  soldiers along the entire length of the frontiers towards the end of the
  first century and left numerous traces around the camps of the Danube and
  the Rhine, near the stations along the wall of Britain, and in the
  vicinity of the army posts scattered along the borders of the Sahara or
  in the valleys of the Asturias. At the same time the Asiatic merchants
  introduced it in the ports of the Mediterranean, along the great
  waterways and roads, and in all commercial cities. It also possessed
  missionaries in the Oriental slaves who were to be found everywhere,
  engaging in every pursuit, employed in the public service as well as in
  domestic work, in the cultivation of land as well as in financial and
  mining enterprises, and above all in the imperial service, where they
  filled the offices.</p>

  <p>Soon this foreign god gained the favor of high functionaries and of
  the sovereign himself. At the end of the second century Commodus was
  initiated into the mysteries, a conversion that had a tremendous effect.
  A hundred years later Mithra's power was such that at one time he seemed
  about to eclipse both Oriental and Occidental rivals and to dominate the
  <!-- Page 150 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page150"></a>[150]</span>entire Roman world. In the year 307
  Diocletian, Galerius and Licinius met in a solemn interview at Carnuntum
  on the Danube and dedicated a sanctuary there to Mithra, "the protector
  of their empire" (<i>fautori imperii sui</i>).<a name="NtA6_32"
  href="#Nt6_32"><sup>[32]</sup></a></p>

  <p>In previous works on the mysteries of Mithra we have endeavored to
  assign causes for the enthusiasm that attracted humble plebeians and
  great men of the world to the altars of this barbarian god. We shall not
  repeat here what any one who has the curiosity may read either in a large
  or a small book according to his preferences,<a name="NtA6_33"
  href="#Nt6_33"><sup>[33]</sup></a> but we must consider the problem from
  a different point of view. Of all Oriental religions the Persian cult was
  the last to reach the Romans. We shall inquire what new principle it
  contained; to what inherent qualities it owed its superiority; and
  through what characteristics it remained distinct in the conflux of
  creeds of all kinds that were struggling for supremacy in the world at
  that time.</p>

  <p>The originality and value of the Persian religion lay not in its
  doctrines regarding the nature of the celestial gods. Without doubt
  Parseeism is of all pagan religions the one that comes closest to
  monotheism, for it elevates Ahura Mazda high above all other celestial
  spirits. But the doctrines of Mithraism are not those of Zoroaster. What
  it received from Persia was chiefly its mythology and ritual; its
  theology, which was thoroughly saturated with Chaldean erudition,
  probably did not differ noticeably from the Syrian. At the head of the
  divine hierarchy it placed as first cause an abstraction, deified Time,
  the Zervan Akarana of the Avesta. This divinity regulated the revolutions
  of the stars and in consequence was the absolute master of <!-- Page 151
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page151"></a>[151]</span>all things.
  Ahura Mazda, whose throne was in the heavens, had become the equivalent
  of <i>Ba&lsquo;al Samin</i>, and even before the magi the Semites had
  introduced into the Occident the worship of the sun, the source of all
  energy and light. Babylonian astrology and astrolatry inspired the
  theories of the mithreums as well as of the Semitic temples, a fact that
  explains the intimate connection of the two cults. This half religious,
  half scientific system which was not peculiarly Persian nor original to
  Mithraism was not the reason for the adoption of that worship by the
  Roman world.</p>

  <p>Neither did the Persian mysteries win the masses by their liturgy.
  Undoubtedly their secret ceremonies performed in mountain caves, or at
  any rate in the darkness of the underground crypts, were calculated to
  inspire awe. Participation in the liturgical meals gave rise to moral
  comfort and stimulation. By submitting to a sort of baptism the votaries
  hoped to expiate their sins and regain an untroubled conscience. But the
  sacred feasts and purifying ablutions connected with the same spiritual
  hopes are found in other Oriental cults, and the magnificent suggestive
  ritual of the Egyptian clergy certainly was more impressive than that of
  the magi. The mythic drama performed in the grottoes of the Persian god
  and culminating in the immolation of a steer who was considered as the
  creator and rejuvenator of the earth, must have seemed less important and
  affecting than the suffering and joy of Isis seeking and reviving the
  mutilated body of her husband, or than the moaning and jubilation of
  Cybele mourning over and reviving her lover Attis.</p>

  <p>But Persia introduced dualism as a fundamental principle in religion.
  It was this that distinguished <!-- Page 152 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page152"></a>[152]</span>Mithraism from other sects and inspired
  its dogmatic theology and ethics, giving them a rigor and firmness
  unknown to Roman paganism. It considered the universe from an entirely
  new point of view and at the same time provided a new goal in life.</p>

  <p>Of course, if we understand by dualism the antithesis of mind and
  matter, of reason and intuition, it appeared at a considerably earlier
  period in Greek philosophy,<a name="NtA6_34"
  href="#Nt6_34"><sup>[34]</sup></a> where it was one of the leading ideas
  of neo-Pythagoreanism and of Philo's system. But the distinguishing
  feature of the doctrine of the magi is the fact that it deified the evil
  principle, set it up as a rival to the supreme deity, and taught that
  both had to be worshiped. This system offered an apparently simple
  solution to the problem of evil, the stumbling block of theologies, and
  it attracted the cultured minds as well as the masses, to whom it
  afforded an explanation of their sufferings. Just as the mysteries of
  Mithra began to spread Plutarch wrote of them favorably and was inclined
  himself to adopt them.<a name="NtA6_35"
  href="#Nt6_35"><sup>[35]</sup></a> From that time dates the appearance in
  literature of the anti-gods <span class="extra" title="moved from footnote"
  >(<span title="antitheoi" class="grk"
  >&#x1F00;&nu;&tau;&#x1F77;&theta;&epsilon;&omicron;&iota;</span>)</span>,<a
  name="NtA6_36" href="#Nt6_36"><sup>[36]</sup></a> under the command of
  the powers of darkness<a name="NtA6_37"
  href="#Nt6_37"><sup>[37]</sup></a> and arrayed against the celestial
  spirits, messengers or "angels"<a name="NtA6_38"
  href="#Nt6_38"><sup>[38]</sup></a> of divinity. They were Ahriman's
  <i>devas</i> struggling with the Yazatas of Ormuzd.</p>

  <p>A curious passage in Porphyry<a name="NtA6_39"
  href="#Nt6_39"><sup>[39]</sup></a> shows that the earliest neo-Platonists
  had already admitted Persian demonology into their system. Below the
  incorporeal and indivisible supreme being, below the stars and the
  planets, there were countless spirits.<a name="NtA6_40"
  href="#Nt6_40"><sup>[40]</sup></a> Some of them, the gods of cities and
  nations, received special names: <!-- Page 153 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page153"></a>[153]</span>the others comprised a
  nameless multitude. They were divided into two groups. The first were the
  benevolent spirits that gave fecundity to plants and animals, serenity to
  nature, and knowledge to men. They acted as intermediaries between gods
  and men, bearing up to heaven the homage and prayers of the faithful, and
  down from heaven portents and warnings. The others were wicked spirits
  inhabiting regions close to the earth and there was no evil that they did
  not exert every effort to cause.<a name="NtA6_41"
  href="#Nt6_41"><sup>[41]</sup></a> At the same time both violent and
  cunning, impetuous and crafty, they were the authors of all the
  calamities that befell the world, such as pestilence, famine, tempests
  and earthquakes. They kindled evil passions and illicit desires in the
  hearts of men and provoked war and sedition. They were clever deceivers
  rejoicing in lies and impostures. They encouraged the phantasmagoria and
  mystification of the sorcerers<a name="NtA6_42"
  href="#Nt6_42"><sup>[42]</sup></a> and gloated over the bloody sacrifices
  which magicians offered to them all, but especially to their chief.</p>

  <p>Doctrines very similar to these were certainly taught in the mysteries
  of Mithra; homage was paid to Ahriman (Arimanius) lord of the somber
  underworld, and master of the infernal spirits.<a name="NtA6_43"
  href="#Nt6_43"><sup>[43]</sup></a> This cult has continued in the Orient
  to the present day among the Yezidis, or devil worshipers.</p>

  <p>In his treatise against the magi, Theodore of Mopsuestia<a
  name="NtA6_44" href="#Nt6_44"><sup>[44]</sup></a> speaks of Ahriman as
  Satan <span class="extra" title="moved from footnote">(<span
  title="Satanas" class="grk"
  >&Sigma;&alpha;&tau;&alpha;&nu;&#x1FB6;&sigmaf;</span>)</span>. At first
  sight there really is a surprising resemblance between the two. Both are
  heads of a numerous army of demons; both are spirits of error and
  falsehood, princes of darkness, <!-- Page 154 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page154"></a>[154]</span>tempters and corrupters. An almost
  identical picture of the pair could be drawn, and in fact they are
  practically the same figure under different names. It is generally
  admitted that Judaism took the notion of an adversary of God<a
  name="NtA6_45" href="#Nt6_45"><sup>[45]</sup></a> from the Mazdeans along
  with portions of their dualism. It was therefore natural that Jewish
  doctrine, of which Christianity is heir, should have been closely allied
  to the mysteries of Mithra. A considerable part of the more or less
  orthodox beliefs and visions that gave the Middle Ages their nightmare of
  hell and the devil thus came from Persia by two channels: on the one hand
  Judeo-Christian literature, both canonical and apocryphal; and on the
  other, the remnants of the Mithra cult and the various sects of
  Manicheism that continued to preach the old Persian doctrines on the
  antagonism between the two world principles.</p>

  <p>But a theoretical adherence of the mind to dogmas that satisfy it,
  does not suffice to convert it to a new religion. There must be motives
  of conduct and a basis for hope besides grounds for belief. The Persian
  dualism was not only a powerful metaphysical conception; it was also the
  foundation of a very efficacious system of ethics, and this was the chief
  agent in the success of the mysteries of Mithra during the second and
  third centuries in the Roman world then animated by unrealized
  aspirations for more perfect justice and holiness.</p>

  <p>A sentence of the Emperor Julian,<a name="NtA6_46"
  href="#Nt6_46"><sup>[46]</sup></a> unfortunately too brief, tells us that
  Mithra subjected his worshipers to "commandments" <span class="extra"
  title="moved from footnote">(<span title="entolai"
  class="grk">&#x1F10;&nu;&tau;&omicron;&lambda;&alpha;&#x1F77;</span>)</span>
  and rewarded faithful observance both in this world and in the next. The
  <!-- Page 155 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page155"></a>[155]</span>importance attached by the Persians to
  their peculiar ethics and the rigor with which they observed its
  precepts, are perhaps the most striking features of their national
  character as manifested in history. They were a race of conquerors
  subject to a severe discipline, like the Romans, and like them they
  realized the necessity of discipline in the administration of a vast
  empire. Certain affinities between the two imperial nations connected
  them directly without the mediation of the Greek world. Mazdaism brought
  long awaited satisfaction to the old-time Roman desire for a practical
  religion that would subject the individual to a rule of conduct and
  contribute to the welfare of the state.<a name="NtA6_47"
  href="#Nt6_47"><sup>[47]</sup></a> Mithra infused a new vigor into the
  paganism of the Occident by introducing the imperative ethics of
  Persia.</p>

  <p>Unhappily the text of the Mithraic decalogue has not been preserved
  and its principal commandments can be restored only by implication.</p>

  <p>Mithra, the ancient spirit of light, became the god of truth and
  justice in the religion of Zoroaster and retained that character in the
  Occident. He was the Mazdean Apollo, but while Hellenism, with a finer
  appreciation of beauty, developed the esthetic qualities in Apollo, the
  Persians, caring more for matters of conscience, emphasized the moral
  character in Mithra.<a name="NtA6_48" href="#Nt6_48"><sup>[48]</sup></a>
  The Greeks, themselves little scrupulous in that respect, were struck by
  the abhorrence in which their Oriental neighbors held a lie. The Persians
  conceived of Ahriman as the embodiment of deceit. Mithra was always the
  god invoked as the guarantor of faith and protector of the inviolability
  of contracts. Absolute fidelity to his oath had to be a cardinal virtue
  <!-- Page 156 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page156"></a>[156]</span>in the religion of a soldier, whose first
  act upon enlistment was to pledge obedience and devotion to the
  sovereign. This religion exalted loyalty and fidelity and undoubtedly
  tried to inspire a feeling similar to our modern idea of honor.</p>

  <p>In addition to respect for authority it preached fraternity. All the
  initiates considered themselves as sons of the same father owing to one
  another a brother's affection. It is a question whether they extended the
  love of neighbor to that universal charity taught by philosophy and
  Christianity. Emperor Julian, a devoted mystic, liked to set up such an
  ideal, and it is probable that the Mithraists of later paganism rose to
  this conception of duty,<a name="NtA6_49"
  href="#Nt6_49"><sup>[49]</sup></a> but they were not its authors. They
  seemed to have attached more importance to the virile qualities than to
  compassion and gentleness. The fraternal spirit of initiates calling
  themselves soldiers was doubtless more akin to the spirit of comradeship
  in a regiment that has <i>esprit de corps</i>, than to the love of one's
  neighbor that inspires works of mercy towards all.</p>

  <p>All primitive people imagine nature filled with unclean and wicked
  spirits that corrupt and torture those who disturb their repose; but
  dualism endowed this universal belief with marvelous power as well as
  with a dogmatic basis. Mazdaism is governed throughout by ideas of purity
  and impurity. "No religion on earth has ever been so completely dominated
  by an ideal of purification."<a name="NtA6_50"
  href="#Nt6_50"><sup>[50]</sup></a> This kind of perfection was the goal
  of the aspiration and effort of believers. They were obliged to guard
  with infinite precaution against defiling the divine elements, for
  instance water or fire, or their own persons, and to wipe out all
  pollution by <!-- Page 157 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page157"></a>[157]</span>repeated lustrations. But, as in the
  Syrian cults of the imperial period, these Mithraic rites did remain
  simply formal, mechanical and of the flesh, inspired by the old idea of
  <i>tabu</i>. Mithraic baptism wiped out moral faults; the purity aimed at
  had become spiritual.</p>

  <p>This perfect purity distinguishes the mysteries of Mithra from those
  of all other Oriental gods. Serapis is the brother and husband of Isis,
  Attis the lover of Cybele, every Syrian Baal is coupled with a spouse;
  but Mithra lives alone. Mithra is chaste, Mithra is holy
  (<i>sanctus</i>),<a name="NtA6_51" href="#Nt6_51"><sup>[51]</sup></a> and
  for the worship of fecundity he substitutes a new reverence for
  continence.</p>

  <p>However, although resistance to sensuality is laudable and although
  the ideal of perfection of this Mazdean sect inclined towards the
  asceticism to which the Manichean conception of virtue led, yet good does
  not consist exclusively in abnegation and self-control, but also in
  action. It is not sufficient for a religion to classify moral values, but
  in order to be effective it must furnish motives for putting them into
  practice. Dualism was peculiarly favorable for the development of
  individual effort and human energy; here its influence was strongest. It
  taught that the world is the scene of a perpetual struggle between two
  powers that share the mastery; the goal to be reached is the
  disappearance of evil and the uncontested dominion, the exclusive reign,
  of the good. Animals and plants, as well as man, are drawn up in two
  rival camps perpetually hostile, and all nature participates in the
  eternal combat of the two opposing principles. The demons created by the
  infernal spirit emerge constantly from the abyss and roam about the
  earth; they penetrate everywhere carrying corruption, distress, <!-- Page
  158 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page158"></a>[158]</span>sickness
  and death. The celestial spirits and the supporters of piety are
  compelled constantly to baffle their ever renewed enterprises. The strife
  continues in the heart and conscience of man, the epitome of the
  universe, between the divine law of duty and the suggestions of the evil
  spirits. Life is a merciless war knowing no truce. The task of the true
  Mazdean consisted in constantly fighting the evil in order to bring about
  the gradual triumph of Ormuzd in the world. The believer was the
  assistant of the gods in their work of purification and improvement.</p>

  <p>The worshipers of Mithra did not lose themselves in a contemplative
  mysticism like other sects. Their morality particularly encouraged
  action, and during a period of laxness, anarchy and confusion, they found
  stimulation, comfort and support in its precepts. Resistance to the
  promptings of degrading instincts assumed the glamor and prestige of
  warlike exploits in their eyes and instilled an active principle of
  progress into their character. By supplying a new conception of the
  world, dualism also gave a new meaning to life. This same dualism
  determined the eschatological beliefs of the Mithraists. The antagonism
  between heaven and hell was extended into the life hereafter.<a
  name="NtA6_52" href="#Nt6_52"><sup>[52]</sup></a> Mithra, the
  "invincible" god who assisted the faithful in their struggle against the
  malignity of the demons, was not only their strong companion in their
  human trials, but as an antagonist of the infernal powers he insured the
  welfare of his followers in the future life as well as on earth. When the
  genius of corruption seizes the corpse after death, the spirits of
  darkness and the celestial messengers struggle for the possession of the
  soul that has left its corporeal prison. It stands <!-- Page 159 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page159"></a>[159]</span>trial before Mithra,
  and if its merits outweigh its shortcomings in the divine balance it is
  defended from Ahriman's agents that seek to drag it into the infernal
  abyss. Finally it is led into the ethereal regions where Jupiter-Ormuzd
  reigns in eternal light. The believers in Mithra did not agree with the
  votaries of Serapis who held that the souls of the just reside in the
  depths of the earth.<a name="NtA6_53" href="#Nt6_53"><sup>[53]</sup></a>
  To them that somber kingdom was the domain of wrong-doers. The souls of
  the just live in the boundless light that extends above the stars, and by
  divesting themselves of all sensuality and all lust in passing through
  the planetary spheres<a name="NtA6_54" href="#Nt6_54"><sup>[54]</sup></a>
  they become as pure as the gods whose company they enter.</p>

  <p>However, when the world came to an end the body also was to share in
  that happiness because it was believed as in Egypt that the whole person
  would enjoy eternal life. After time had run its course Mithra would
  raise all men from the dead, pouring out a marvelous beverage of
  immortality for the good, but all evil doers would be annihilated by fire
  together with Ahriman himself.</p>

<hr class="short" >

  <p>Of all the Oriental cults none was so severe as Mithraism, none
  attained an equal moral elevation, none could have had so strong a hold
  on mind and heart. In many respects it gave its definite religious
  formula to the pagan world and the influence of its ideas remained long
  after the religion itself had come to a violent end. Persian dualism
  introduced certain principles into Europe that have never ceased to exert
  an influence. Its whole history proves the thesis with which we began,
  the power of resistance and of <!-- Page 160 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page160"></a>[160]</span>influence possessed by Persian culture and
  religion. These possessed an originality so independent that after having
  resisted in the Orient the power of absorption of Hellenism, and after
  having checked the Christian propaganda, they even withstood the
  destructive power of Islam. Firdusi (940-1020) glories in the ancient
  national traditions and the mythical heroes of Mazdaism, and while the
  idolatry of Egypt, Syria and Asia Minor has long since died out or
  degenerated, there are votaries of Zoroaster at the present day who
  piously perform the sacred ceremonies of the Avesta and practise genuine
  fire worship.</p>

  <p>Another witness to the vitality of Mithraic Mazdaism is the fact that
  it escaped becoming a kind of state religion of the Roman empire during
  the third century. An oft-quoted sentence of Renan's says:<a
  name="NtA6_55" href="#Nt6_55"><sup>[55]</sup></a> "If Christianity had
  been checked in its growth by some deadly disease, the world would have
  become Mithraic." In hazarding that statement he undoubtedly conjured up
  a picture of what would have been the condition of this poor world in
  that case. He must have imagined, one of his followers would have us
  believe,<a name="NtA6_56" href="#Nt6_56"><sup>[56]</sup></a> that the
  morals of the human race would have been but little changed, a little
  more virile perhaps, a little less charitable, but only a shade
  different. The erudite theology taught by the mysteries would obviously
  have shown a laudable respect for science, but as its dogmas were based
  upon a false physics it would apparently have insured the persistence of
  an infinity of errors. Astronomy would not be lacking, but astrology
  would have been unassailable, while the heavens would still be revolving
  around the earth to accord with its doctrines. The greatest <!-- Page 161
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page161"></a>[161]</span>danger, it
  appears to me, would have been that the Cæsars would have established a
  theocratic absolutism supported by the Oriental ideas of the divinity of
  kings. The union of throne and altar would have been inseparable, and
  Europe would never have known the invigorating struggle between church
  and state. But on the other hand the discipline of Mithraism, so
  productive of individual energy, and the democratic organization of its
  societies in which senators and slaves rubbed elbows, contain a germ of
  liberty.</p>

  <p>We might dwell at some length on these contrasting possibilities, but
  it is hard to find a mental pastime less profitable than the attempt to
  remake history and to conjecture on what might have been had events
  proved otherwise. If the torrent of actions and reactions that carries us
  along were turned out of its course what imagination could describe the
  unknown regions through which it would flow?</p>

<h3>ASTROLOGY AND MAGIC.</h3>

  <p>When we consider the absolute authority that astrology exercised under
  the Roman empire, we find it hard to escape a feeling of surprise. It is
  difficult to think that people could ever consider astrology as the most
  valuable of all arts and the queen of sciences,<a name="NtA7_1"
  href="#Nt7_1"><sup>[1]</sup></a> and it is not easy for us to imagine the
  moral conditions that made such a phenomenon possible, because our state
  of mind to-day is very different. Little by little the conviction has
  gained ground that all that can be known about the future, at least the
  future of man and of human society, is conjecture. The progress of
  knowledge has taught man to acquiesce in his ignorance.</p>

  <p>In former ages it was different: forebodings and predictions found
  universal credence. The ancient forms of divination, however, had fallen
  somewhat into disrepute at the beginning of our era, like the rest of the
  Greco-Roman religion. It was no longer thought that the eagerness or
  reluctance with which the sacred hens ate their paste, or the direction
  of the flight of the birds indicated coming success or disaster.
  Abandoned, the Hellenic oracles were silent. Then appeared astrology,
  surrounded with all the prestige of an exact science, and based upon the
  experience of many centuries. It promised to ascertain the <!-- Page 163
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page163"></a>[163]</span>occurrences of
  any one's life with as much precision as the date of an eclipse. The
  world was drawn towards it by an irresistible attraction. Astrology did
  away with, and gradually relegated to oblivion, all the ancient methods
  that had been devised to solve the enigmas of the future. Haruspicy and
  the augural art were abandoned, and not even the ancient fame of the
  oracles could save them from falling into irretrievable desuetude. This
  great chimera changed religion as well as divination, its spirit
  penetrated everything. And truly, if, as some scholars still hold, the
  main feature of science is the ability to predict,<a name="NtA7_2"
  href="#Nt7_2"><sup>[2]</sup></a> no branch of learning could compare with
  this one, nor escape its influence.</p>

  <p>The success of astrology was connected with that of the Oriental
  religions, which lent it their support, as it in turn helped them. We
  have seen how it forced itself upon Semitic paganism, how it transformed
  Persian Mazdaism and even subdued the arrogance of the Egyptian
  sacerdotal caste.<a name="NtA7_3" href="#Nt7_3"><sup>[3]</sup></a>
  Certain mystical treatises ascribed to the old Pharaoh Nechepso and his
  confidant, the priest Petosiris, nebulous and abstruse works that became,
  one might say, the Bible of the new belief in the power of the stars,
  were translated into Greek, undoubtedly in Alexandria, about the year 150
  before our era.<a name="NtA7_4" href="#Nt7_4"><sup>[4]</sup></a> About
  the same time the Chaldean genethlialogy began to spread in Italy, with
  regard to which Berosus, a priest of the god Baal, who came to Babylon
  from the island of Cos, had previously succeeded in arousing the
  curiosity of the Greeks. In 139 a prætor expelled the "Chaldaei" from
  Rome, together with the Jews. But all the adherents of the Syrian
  goddess, of whom there was quite a number in the Occident, were patrons
  and defenders of these Oriental <!-- Page 164 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page164"></a>[164]</span>prophets, and police measures were no more
  successful in stopping the diffusion of their doctrines, than in the case
  of the Asiatic mysteries. In the time of Pompey, the senator Nigidius
  Figulus, who was an ardent occultist, expounded the barbarian uranography
  in Latin. But the scholar whose authority contributed most to the final
  acceptance of sidereal divination was a Syrian philosopher of
  encyclopedic knowledge, Posidonius of Apamea, the teacher of Cicero.<a
  name="NtA7_5" href="#Nt7_5"><sup>[5]</sup></a> The works of that erudite
  and religious writer influenced the development of the entire Roman
  theology more than anything else.</p>

  <p>Under the empire, while the Semitic Baals and Mithra were triumphing,
  astrology manifested its power everywhere. During that period everybody
  bowed to it. The Cæsars became its fervent devotees, frequently at the
  expense of the ancient cults. Tiberius neglected the gods because he
  believed only in fatalism,<a name="NtA7_6"
  href="#Nt7_6"><sup>[6]</sup></a> and Otho, blindly confiding in the
  Oriental seer, marched against Vitellius in spite of the baneful presages
  that affrighted his official clergy.<a name="NtA7_7"
  href="#Nt7_7"><sup>[7]</sup></a> The most earnest scholars, Ptolemy under
  the Antonines for instance, expounded the principles of that
  pseudo-science, and the very best minds received them. In fact, scarcely
  anybody made a distinction between astronomy and its illegitimate sister.
  Literature took up this new and difficult subject, and, as early as the
  time of Augustus or Tiberius, Manilius, inspired by the sidereal
  fatalism, endeavored to make poetry of that dry "mathematics," as
  Lucretius, his forerunner, had done with the Epicurean atomism. Even art
  looked there for inspiration and depicted the stellar deities. At Rome
  and in the provinces architects erected sumptuous <i>septizonia</i> in
  the likeness of <!-- Page 165 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page165"></a>[165]</span>the seven spheres in which the planets
  that rule our destinies move.<a name="NtA7_8"
  href="#Nt7_8"><sup>[8]</sup></a> This Asiatic divination was first
  aristocratic<a name="NtA7_9"
  href="#Nt7_9"><sup>[9]</sup></a>&mdash;because the obtaining of an exact
  horoscope was a complicated matter, and consultations were
  expensive&mdash;but it promptly became popular, especially in the urban
  centers where Oriental slaves gathered in large numbers. The learned
  genethlialogers of the observatories had unlicensed colleagues, who told
  fortunes at street-crossings or in barnyards. Even common epitaphs, which
  Rossi styles "the scum of inscriptions," have retained traces of that
  belief. The custom arose of stating in epitaphs the exact length of a
  life to the very hour, for the moment of birth determined that of
  death:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p><i>Nascentes morimur, finisque ab origine pendet.</i><a name="NtA7_10" href="#Nt7_10"><sup>[10]</sup></a></p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Soon neither important nor small matters were undertaken without
  consulting the astrologer. His previsions were sought not only in regard
  to great public events like the conduct of a war, the founding of a city,
  or the accession of a ruler, not only in case of a marriage, a journey,
  or a change of domicile; but the most trifling acts of every-day life
  were gravely submitted to his sagacity. People would no longer take a
  bath, go to the barber, change their clothes or manicure their
  fingernails, without first awaiting the propitious moment.<a
  name="NtA7_11" href="#Nt7_11"><sup>[11]</sup></a> The collections of
  "initiatives" <span class="extra" title="moved from footnote">(<span
  title="katarchai" class="grk"
  >&kappa;&alpha;&tau;&alpha;&rho;&chi;&alpha;&#x1F77;</span>)</span> that
  have come to us contain questions that make us smile: Will a son who is
  about to be born have a big nose? Will a girl just coming into this world
  have gallant adventures?<a name="NtA7_12"
  href="#Nt7_12"><sup>[12]</sup></a> And certain precepts sound almost like
  burlesques: he who gets his hair cut while <!-- Page 166 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page166"></a>[166]</span>the moon is in her
  increase will become bald&mdash;evidently by analogy.<a name="NtA7_13"
  href="#Nt7_13"><sup>[13]</sup></a></p>

  <p>The entire existence of states and individuals, down to the slightest
  incidents, was thought to depend on the stars. The absolute control they
  were supposed to exercise over everybody's daily condition, even modified
  the language in every-day use and left traces in almost all idioms
  derived from the Latin. If we speak of a martial, or a jovial character,
  or a lunatic, we are unconsciously admitting the existence, in these
  heavenly bodies (Mars, Jupiter, Luna) of their ancient qualities.</p>

  <p>It must be acknowledged, however, that the Grecian spirit tried to
  combat the folly that was taking hold of the world, and from the time of
  its propagation astrology found opponents among the philosophers. The
  most subtle of these adversaries was the probabilist Carneades, in the
  second century before our era. The topical arguments which he advanced,
  were taken up, reproduced, and developed in a thousand ways by later
  polemicists. For instance, Were all the men that perish together in a
  battle, born at the same moment, because they had the same fate? Or, on
  the other hand, do we not observe that twins, born at the same time, have
  the most unlike characters and the most different fortunes?</p>

  <p>But dialectics are an accomplishment in which the Greeks ever
  excelled, and the defenders of astrology found a reply to every
  objection. They endeavored especially to establish firmly the truths of
  observation, upon which rested the entire learned structure of their art:
  the influence of the stars over the phenomena of nature and the
  characters of individuals. Can it be <!-- Page 167 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page167"></a>[167]</span>denied, they said, that
  the sun causes vegetation to appear and to perish, and that it puts
  animals <i>en rut</i> or plunges them into lethargic sleep? Does not the
  movement of the tide depend on the course of the moon? Is not the rising
  of certain constellations accompanied every year by storms? And are not
  the physical and moral qualities of the different races manifestly
  determined by the climate in which they live? The action of the sky on
  the earth is undeniable, and, the sidereal influences once admitted, all
  previsions based on them are legitimate. As soon as the first principle
  is admitted, all corollaries are logically derived from it.</p>

  <p>This way of reasoning was universally considered irrefutable. Before
  the advent of Christianity, which especially opposed it because of its
  idolatrous character, astrology had scarcely any adversaries except those
  who denied the possibility of science altogether, namely, the
  neo-Academicians, who held that man could not attain certainty, and such
  radical sceptics as Sextus Empiricus. Upheld by the Stoics, however, who
  with very few exceptions were in favor of astrology, it can be maintained
  that it emerged triumphant from the first assaults directed against it.
  The only result of the objections raised to it was to modify some of its
  theories. Later, the general weakening of the spirit of criticism assured
  astrology an almost uncontested domination. Its adversaries did not renew
  their polemics; they limited themselves to the repetition of arguments
  that had been opposed, if not refuted, a hundred times, and consequently
  seemed worn out. At the court of the Severi any one who should have
  denied the influence of the planets upon the events of this world <!--
  Page 168 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page168"></a>[168]</span>would
  have been considered more preposterous than he who would admit it
  to-day.</p>

  <p>But, you will say, if the theorists did not succeed in proving the
  doctrinal falsity of astrology, experience should have shown its
  worthlessness. Errors must have occurred frequently and must have been
  followed by cruel disillusionment. Having lost a child at the age of four
  for whom a brilliant future had been predicted, the parents stigmatized
  in the epitaph the "lying mathematician whose great renown deluded
  them."<a name="NtA7_14" href="#Nt7_14"><sup>[14]</sup></a> Nobody thought
  of denying the possibility of such errors. Manuscripts have been
  preserved, wherein the makers of horoscopes themselves candidly and
  learnedly explain how they were mistaken in such and such a case, because
  they had not taken into account some one of the data of the problem.<a
  name="NtA7_15" href="#Nt7_15"><sup>[15]</sup></a> Manilius, in spite of
  his unlimited confidence in the power of reason, hesitated at the
  complexity of an immense task that seemed to exceed the capacity of human
  intelligence,<a name="NtA7_16" href="#Nt7_16"><sup>[16]</sup></a> and in
  the second century, Vettius Valens bitterly denounced the contemptible
  bunglers who claimed to be prophets, without having had the long training
  necessary, and who thereby cast odium and ridicule upon astrology, in the
  name of which they pretended to operate.<a name="NtA7_17"
  href="#Nt7_17"><sup>[17]</sup></a> It must be remembered that astrology,
  like medicine, was not only a science <span class="extra" title="moved from footnote"
  >(<span title="epistêmê" class="grk"
  >&#x1F10;&pi;&iota;&sigma;&tau;&#x1F75;&mu;&eta;</span>)</span>, but also
  an art <span class="extra" title="moved from footnote">(<span
  title="technê" class="grk">&tau;&#x1F73;&chi;&nu;&eta;</span>)</span>.
  This comparison, which sounds irreverent to-day, was a flattering one in
  the eyes of the ancients.<a name="NtA7_18"
  href="#Nt7_18"><sup>[18]</sup></a> To observe the sky was as delicate a
  task as to observe the human body; to cast the horoscope of a newly born
  child, just as perilous as to make a diagnosis, and to interpret the
  cosmic symptoms just as hard as to <!-- Page 169 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page169"></a>[169]</span>interpret those of our
  organism. In both instances the elements were complex and the chances of
  error infinite. All the examples of patients dying in spite of the
  physician, or on account of him, will never keep a person who is tortured
  by physical pain from appealing to him for help; and similarly those
  whose souls were troubled with ambition or fear turned to the astrologer
  for some remedy for the moral fever tormenting them. The calculator, who
  claimed to determine the moment of death, and the medical practitioner
  who claimed to avert it received the anxious patronage of people worried
  by this formidable issue. Furthermore, just as marvelous cures were
  reported, striking predictions were called to mind or, if need were,
  invented. The diviner had, as a rule, only a restricted number of
  possibilities to deal with, and the calculus of probabilities shows that
  he must have succeeded sometimes. Mathematics, which he invoked, was in
  his favor after all, and chance frequently corrected mischance. Moreover,
  did not the man who had a well-frequented consulting-office, possess a
  thousand means, if he was clever, of placing all the chances on his side,
  in the hazardous profession he followed, and of reading in the stars
  anything he thought expedient? He observed the earth rather than the sky,
  and took care not to fall into a well.</p>

<hr class="short" >

  <p>However, what helped most to make astrology invulnerable to the blows
  of reason and of common sense, was the fact that in reality, the apparent
  rigor of its calculus and its theorems notwithstanding, it was not a
  science but a faith. We mean not only that <!-- Page 170 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page170"></a>[170]</span>it implied belief in
  postulates that could not be proved&mdash;the same thing might be said of
  almost all of our poor human knowledge, and even our systems of physics
  and cosmology in the last analysis are based upon hypotheses&mdash;but
  that astrology was born and reared in the temples of Chaldea and Egypt.<a
  name="NtA7_19" href="#Nt7_19"><sup>[19]</sup></a> Even in the Occident it
  never forgot its sacerdotal origin and never more than half freed itself
  from religion, whose offspring it was. Here lies the connection between
  astrology and the Oriental religions, and I wish to draw the reader's
  special attention to this point.</p>

  <p>The Greek works and treatises on astrology that have come down to us
  reveal this essential feature only very imperfectly. The Byzantines
  stripped this pseudo-science, always regarded suspiciously by the church,
  of everything that savored of paganism. Their process of purification
  can, in some instances, be traced from manuscript to manuscript.<a
  name="NtA7_20" href="#Nt7_20"><sup>[20]</sup></a> If they retained the
  name of some god or hero of mythology, the only way they dared to write
  it was by cryptography. They have especially preserved purely didactic
  treatises, the most perfect type of which is Ptolemy's Tetrabiblos which
  has been constantly quoted and commented upon; and they have reproduced
  almost exclusively expurgated texts, in which the principles of various
  doctrines are drily summarized. During the classic age works of a
  different character were commonly read. Many "Chaldeans" interspersed
  their cosmological calculations and theories with moral considerations
  and mystical speculations. In the first part of a work that he names
  "Vision," <span class="extra" title="moved from footnote">(<span
  title="Horasis" class="grk"
  >&#x1F4D;&rho;&alpha;&sigma;&iota;&sigmaf;</span>)</span> Critodemus, in
  prophetic language, represents the truths he reveals <!-- Page 171
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page171"></a>[171]</span>as a secure
  harbor of refuge from the storms of this world, and he promises his
  readers to raise them to the rank of immortals.<a name="NtA7_21"
  href="#Nt7_21"><sup>[21]</sup></a> Vettius Valens, a contemporary of
  Marcus Aurelius, implored them in solemn terms, not to divulge to the
  ignorant and impious the arcana he was about to acquaint them with.<a
  name="NtA7_22" href="#Nt7_22"><sup>[22]</sup></a> The astrologers liked
  to assume the appearance of incorruptible and holy priests and to
  consider their calling a sacerdotal one.<a name="NtA7_23"
  href="#Nt7_23"><sup>[23]</sup></a> In fact, the two ministries sometimes
  combined: A dignitary of the Mithraic clergy called himself <i>studiosus
  astrologiae</i><a name="NtA7_24" href="#Nt7_24"><sup>[24]</sup></a> in
  his epitaph, and a member of a prominent family of Phrygian prelates
  celebrated in verse the science of divination which enabled him to issue
  a number of infallible predictions.<a name="NtA7_25"
  href="#Nt7_25"><sup>[25]</sup></a></p>

  <p>The sacred character of astrology revealed itself in some passages
  that escaped the orthodox censure and in the tone some of its followers
  assumed, but we must go further and show that astrology was religious in
  its principles as well as in its conclusions, the debt it owed to
  mathematics and observation notwithstanding.</p>

  <p>The fundamental dogma of astrology, as conceived by the Greeks, was
  that of universal solidarity. The world is a vast organism, all the parts
  of which are connected through an unceasing exchange of molecules of
  effluvia. The stars, inexhaustible generators of energy, constantly act
  upon the earth and man&mdash;upon man, the epitome of all nature, a
  "microcosm" whose every element corresponds to some part of the starry
  sky. This was, in a few words, the theory formulated by the Stoic
  disciples of the Chaldeans;<a name="NtA7_26"
  href="#Nt7_26"><sup>[26]</sup></a> but if we divest it of all the
  philosophic garments with which it has been adorned, what do we find? The
  idea of <!-- Page 172 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page172"></a>[172]</span>sympathy, a belief as old as human
  society! The savage peoples also established mysterious relations between
  all bodies and all the beings that inhabit the earth and the heavens, and
  which to them were animated with a life of their own endowed with latent
  power, but we shall speak of this later on, when taking up the subject of
  magic. Even before the propagation of the Oriental religions, popular
  superstition in Italy and Greece attributed a number of odd actions to
  the sun, the moon, and the constellations as well.<a name="NtA7_27"
  href="#Nt7_27"><sup>[27]</sup></a></p>

  <p>The Chaldaei, however, claimed a predominant power for the stars. In
  fact, they were regarded as gods <i>par excellence</i> by the religion of
  the ancient Chaldeans in its beginnings. The sidereal religion of Babylon
  concentrated deity, one might say, in the luminous moving bodies at the
  expense of other natural objects, such as stones, plants, animals, which
  the primitive Semitic faith considered equally divine. The stars always
  retained this character, even at Rome. They were not, as to us,
  infinitely distant bodies moving in space according to the inflexible
  laws of mechanics, and whose chemical composition may be determined. To
  the Latins as to the Orientals, they were propitious or baleful deities,
  whose ever-changing relations determined the events of this world.</p>

  <p>The sky, whose unfathomable depth had not yet been perceived, was
  peopled with heroes and monsters of contrary passions, and the struggle
  above had an immediate echo upon earth. By what principle have such a
  quality and so great an influence been attributed to the stars? Is it for
  reasons derived from their apparent motion and known through observation
  or experience? Sometimes. Saturn made people <!-- Page 173 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page173"></a>[173]</span>apathetic and
  irresolute, because it moved most slowly of all the planets.<a
  name="NtA7_28" href="#Nt7_28"><sup>[28]</sup></a> But in most instances
  purely mythological reasons inspired the precepts of astrology. The seven
  planets were associated with certain deities, Mars, Venus, or Mercury,
  whose character and history are known to all. It is sufficient simply to
  pronounce their names to call to mind certain personalities that may be
  expected to act according to their natures, in every instance. It was
  natural for Venus to favor lovers, and for Mercury to assure the success
  of business transactions and dishonest deals. The same applies to the
  constellations, with which a number of legends are connected:
  "catasterism" or translation into the stars, became the natural
  conclusion of a great many tales. The heroes of mythology, or even those
  of human society, continued to live in the sky in the form of brilliant
  stars. There Perseus again met Andromeda, and the Centaur Chiron, who is
  none other than Sagittarius, was on terms of good fellowship with the
  Dioscuri.</p>

  <p>These constellations, then, assumed to a certain extent the good and
  the bad qualities of the mythical or historical beings that had been
  transferred upon them. For instance, the serpent, which shines near the
  northern pole, was the author of medical cures, because it was the animal
  sacred to Æsculapius.<a name="NtA7_29"
  href="#Nt7_29"><sup>[29]</sup></a></p>

  <p>The religious foundation of the rules of astrology, however, can not
  always be recognized. Sometimes it is entirely forgotten, and in such
  cases the rules assume the appearance of axioms, or of laws based upon
  long observation of celestial phenomena. Here we have a simple aspect of
  science. The process of <!-- Page 174 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page174"></a>[174]</span>assimilation with the gods and catasterism
  were known in the Orient long before they were practiced in Greece.</p>

  <p>The traditional outlines that we reproduce on our celestial maps are
  the fossil remains of a luxuriant mythological vegetation, and besides
  our classic sphere the ancients knew another, the "barbarian" sphere,
  peopled with a world of fantastic persons and animals. These sidereal
  monsters, to whom powerful qualities were ascribed, were likewise the
  remnants of a multitude of forgotten beliefs. Zoolatry was abandoned in
  the temples, but people continued to regard as divine the lion, the bull,
  the bear, and the fishes, which the Oriental imagination had seen in the
  starry vault. Old totems of the Semitic tribes or of the Egyptian
  divisions lived again, transformed into constellations. Heterogeneous
  elements, taken from all the religions of the Orient, were combined in
  the uranography of the ancients, and in the power ascribed to the
  phantoms that it evoked, vibrates in the indistinct echo of ancient
  devotions that are often completely unknown to us.<a name="NtA7_30"
  href="#Nt7_30"><sup>[30]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Astrology, then, was religious in its origin and in its principles. It
  was religious also in its close relation to the Oriental religions,
  especially those of the Syrian Baals and of Mithra; finally, it was
  religious in the effects that it produced. I do not mean the effects
  expected from a constellation in any particular instance: as for example
  the power to evoke the gods that were subject to their domination.<a
  name="NtA7_31" href="#Nt7_31"><sup>[31]</sup></a> But I have in mind the
  general influence those doctrines exercised upon Roman paganism.</p>

  <p>When the Olympian gods were incorporated among the stars, when Saturn
  and Jupiter became planets and <!-- Page 175 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page175"></a>[175]</span>the celestial virgin a sign of the zodiac,
  they assumed a character very different from the one they had originally
  possessed. It has been shown<a name="NtA7_32"
  href="#Nt7_32"><sup>[32]</sup></a> how, in Syria, the idea of an infinite
  repetition of cycles of years according to which the celestial
  revolutions took place, led to the conception of divine eternity, how the
  theory of a fatal domination of the stars over the earth brought about
  that of the omnipotence of the "lord of the heavens," and how the
  introduction of a universal religion was the necessary result of the
  belief that the stars exerted an influence upon the peoples of every
  climate. The logic of all these consequences of the principles of
  astrology was plain to the Latin as well as to the Semitic races, and
  caused a rapid transformation of the ancient idolatry. As in Syria, the
  sun, which the astrologers called the leader of the planetary choir, "who
  is established as king and leader of the whole world,"<a name="NtA7_33"
  href="#Nt7_33"><sup>[33]</sup></a> necessarily became the highest power
  of the Roman pantheon.</p>

  <p>Astrology also modified theology, by introducing into this pantheon a
  great number of new gods, some of whom were singularly abstract.
  Thereafter man worshiped the constellations of the firmament, <span
  class="correction" title="text reads `particutarly'">particularly</span>
  the twelve signs of the zodiac, every one of which had its mythologic
  legend; the sky (<i>Caelus</i>) itself, because it was considered the
  first cause, and was sometimes confused with the supreme being; the four
  elements, the antithesis and perpetual transmutations of which produced
  all tangible phenomena, and which were often symbolized by a group of
  animals ready to devour each other;<a name="NtA7_34"
  href="#Nt7_34"><sup>[34]</sup></a> finally, time and its subdivisions.<a
  name="NtA7_35" href="#Nt7_35"><sup>[35]</sup></a></p>

  <p>The calendars were religious before they were secular; their purpose
  was not, primarily, to record fleeting <!-- Page 176 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page176"></a>[176]</span>time, but to observe
  the recurrence of propitious or inauspicious dates separated by periodic
  intervals. It is a matter of experience that the return of certain
  moments is associated with the appearance of certain phenomena; they
  have, therefore, a special efficacy, and are endowed with a sacred
  character. By determining periods with mathematical exactness, astrology
  continued to see in them "a divine power,"<a name="NtA7_36"
  href="#Nt7_36"><sup>[36]</sup></a> to use Zeno's term. Time, that
  regulates the course of the stars and the transubstantiation of the
  elements, was conceived of as the master of the gods and the primordial
  principle, and was likened to destiny. Each part of its infinite duration
  brought with it some propitious or evil movement of the sky that was
  anxiously observed, and transformed the ever modified universe. The
  centuries, the years and the seasons, placed into relation with the four
  winds and the four cardinal points, the <span class="correction"
  title="text reads `tweleve'">twelve</span> months connected with the
  zodiac, the day and the night, the twelve hours, all were personified and
  deified, as the authors of every change in the universe. The allegorical
  figures contrived for these abstractions by astrological paganism did not
  even perish with it.<a name="NtA7_37" href="#Nt7_37"><sup>[37]</sup></a>
  The symbolism it had disseminated outlived it, and until the Middle Ages
  these pictures of fallen gods were reproduced indefinitely in sculpture,
  mosaics, and in Christian miniatures.<a name="NtA7_38"
  href="#Nt7_38"><sup>[38]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Thus astrology entered into all religious ideas, and the doctrines of
  the destiny of the world and of man harmonized with its teachings.
  According to Berosus, who is the interpreter of ancient Chaldean
  theories, the existence of the universe consisted of a series of "big
  years," each having its summer and its winter. Their summer took place
  when all the planets were in <!-- Page 177 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page177"></a>[177]</span>conjunction at the same point of Cancer,
  and brought with it a general conflagration. On the other hand, their
  winter came when all the planets were joined in Capricorn, and its result
  was a universal flood. Each of these cosmic cycles, the duration of which
  was fixed at 432,000 years according to the most probable estimate, was
  an exact reproduction of those that had preceded it. In fact, when the
  stars resumed exactly the same position, they were forced to act in
  identically the same manner as before. This Babylonian theory, an
  anticipation of that of the "eternal return of things," which Nietzsche
  boasts of having discovered, enjoyed lasting popularity during antiquity,
  and in various forms came down to the Renaissance.<a name="NtA7_39"
  href="#Nt7_39"><sup>[39]</sup></a> The belief that the world would be
  destroyed by fire, a theory also spread abroad by the Stoics, found a new
  support in these cosmic speculations.</p>

  <p>Astrology, however, revealed the future not only of the universe, but
  also of man. According to a Chaldeo-Persian doctrine, accepted by the
  pagan mystics and previously pointed out by us,<a name="NtA7_40"
  href="#Nt7_40"><sup>[40]</sup></a> a bitter necessity compelled the souls
  that dwell in great numbers on the celestial heights, to descend upon
  this earth and to animate certain bodies that are to hold them in
  captivity. In descending to the earth they travel through the spheres of
  the planets and receive some quality from each of these wandering stars,
  according to its positions. Contrariwise, when death releases them from
  their carnal prison, they return to their first habitation, providing
  they have led a pious life, and if as they pass through the doors of the
  superposed heavens they divest themselves of the passions and
  inclinations acquired during their first journey, <!-- Page 178 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page178"></a>[178]</span>to ascend finally, as
  pure essence to the radiant abode of the gods. There they live forever
  among the eternal stars, freed from the tyranny of destiny and even from
  the limitations of time.</p>

  <p>This alliance of the theorems of astronomy with their old beliefs
  supplied the Chaldeans with answers to all the questions that men asked
  concerning the relation of heaven and earth, the nature of God, the
  existence of the world, and their own destiny. Astrology was really the
  first scientific theology. Hellenistic logic arranged the Oriental
  doctrines properly, combined them with the Stoic philosophy and built
  them up into a system of <span class="correction" title="text reads `indiputable'"
  >indisputable</span> grandeur, an ideal reconstruction of the universe,
  the powerful assurance of which inspired Manilius to sublime language
  when he was not exhausted by his efforts to master an ill-adapted
  theme.<a name="NtA7_41" href="#Nt7_41"><sup>[41]</sup></a> The vague and
  irrational notion of "sympathy" is transformed into a deep sense of the
  relationship between the human soul, an igneous substance, and the divine
  stars, and this feeling is strengthened by thought.<a name="NtA7_42"
  href="#Nt7_42"><sup>[42]</sup></a> The contemplation of the sky has
  become a communion. During the splendor of night the mind of man became
  intoxicated with the light streaming from above; born on the wings of
  enthusiasm, he ascended into the sacred choir of the stars and took part
  in their harmonious movements. "He participates in their immortality,
  and, before his appointed hour, converses with the gods."<a
  name="NtA7_43" href="#Nt7_43"><sup>[43]</sup></a> In spite of the subtle
  precision the Greeks always maintained in their speculations, the feeling
  that permeated astrology down to the end of paganism never belied its
  Oriental and religious origin. <!-- Page 179 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page179"></a>[179]</span></p>

  <p>The most essential principle of astrology was that of fatalism. As the
  poet says:<a name="NtA7_44" href="#Nt7_44"><sup>[44]</sup></a></p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p><i>"Fata regunt orbem, certa stant omnia lege."</i></p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>The Chaldeans were the first to conceive the idea of an inflexible
  necessity ruling the universe, instead of gods acting in the world
  according to their passions, like men in society. They noticed that an
  immutable law regulated the movements of the celestial bodies, and, in
  the first enthusiasm of their discovery they extended its effects to all
  moral and social phenomena. The postulates of astrology imply an absolute
  determinism. Tyche, or deified fortune, became the irresistible mistress
  of mortals and immortals alike, and was even worshiped exclusively by
  some under the empire. Our deliberate will never plays more than a very
  limited part in our happiness and success, but, among the pronunciamentos
  and in the anarchy of the third century, blind chance seemed to play with
  the life of every one according to its fancy, and it can easily be
  understood that the ephemeral rulers of that period, like the masses, saw
  in chance the sovereign disposer of their fates.<a name="NtA7_45"
  href="#Nt7_45"><sup>[45]</sup></a></p>

  <p>The power of this fatalist conception during antiquity may be measured
  by its long persistence, at least in the Orient, where it originated.
  Starting from Babylonia,<a name="NtA7_46"
  href="#Nt7_46"><sup>[46]</sup></a> it spread over the entire Hellenic
  world, as early as the Alexandrian period, and towards the end of
  paganism a considerable part of the efforts of the Christian apologists
  was directed against it.<a name="NtA7_47"
  href="#Nt7_47"><sup>[47]</sup></a> But it was destined to outlast all
  attacks, and to impose itself even on Islam.<a name="NtA7_48"
  href="#Nt7_48"><sup>[48]</sup></a> In Latin Europe, in spite of the
  anathemas of the church, the belief remained confusedly <!-- Page 180
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page180"></a>[180]</span>alive all
  through the Middle Ages that on this earth everything happens
  somewhat</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Per ovra delle rote magne,</p>
      <p>Che drizzan ciascun seme ad alcun fine</p>
      <p>Secondo che le stella son campagne."<a name="NtA7_49" href="#Nt7_49"><sup>[49]</sup></a></p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>The weapons used by the ecclesiastic writers in contending against
  this sidereal fatalism were taken from the arsenal of the old Greek
  dialectics. In general, they were those that all defenders of free will
  had used for centuries: determinism destroys responsibility; rewards and
  punishments are absurd if man acts under a necessity that compels him, if
  he is born a hero or a criminal. We shall not dwell on these metaphysical
  discussions,<a name="NtA7_50" href="#Nt7_50"><sup>[50]</sup></a> but
  there is one argument that is more closely connected with our subject,
  and therefore should be mentioned. If we live under an immutable fate, no
  supplication can change its decisions; religion is unavailing, it is
  useless to ask the oracles to reveal the secrets of a future which
  nothing can change, and prayers, to use one of Seneca's expressions, are
  nothing but "the solace of diseased minds."<a name="NtA7_51"
  href="#Nt7_51"><sup>[51]</sup></a></p>

  <p>And, doubtless, some adepts of astrology, like the Emperor Tiberius,<a
  name="NtA7_52" href="#Nt7_52"><sup>[52]</sup></a> neglected the practice
  of religion, because they were convinced that fate governed all things.
  Following the example set by the Stoics, they made absolute submission to
  an almighty fate and joyful acceptance of the inevitable a moral duty,
  and were satisfied to worship the superior power that ruled the universe,
  without demanding anything in return. They considered themselves at the
  mercy of even the most capricious fate, and were like the intelligent
  slave who guesses the desires of his master to satisfy them, and <!--
  Page 181 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page181"></a>[181]</span>knows
  how to make the hardest servitude tolerable.<a name="NtA7_53"
  href="#Nt7_53"><sup>[53]</sup></a> The masses, however, never reached
  that height of resignation. They looked at astrology far more from a
  religious than from a logical standpoint.<a name="NtA7_54"
  href="#Nt7_54"><sup>[54]</sup></a> The planets and constellations were
  not only cosmic forces, whose favorable or inauspicious action grew
  weaker or stronger according to the turnings of a course established for
  eternity; they were deities who saw and heard, who were glad or sad, who
  had a voice and sex, who were prolific or sterile, gentle or savage,
  obsequious or arrogant.<a name="NtA7_55"
  href="#Nt7_55"><sup>[55]</sup></a> Their anger could therefore be soothed
  and their favor obtained through rites and offerings; even the adverse
  stars were not unrelenting and could be persuaded through sacrifices and
  supplications. The narrow and pedantic Firmicus Maternus strongly asserts
  the omnipotence of fate, but at the same time he invokes the gods and
  asks for their aid against the influence of the stars. As late as the
  fourth century the pagans of Rome who were about to marry, or to make a
  purchase, or to solicit a public office, went to the diviner for his
  prognostics, at the same time praying to Fate for prosperity in their
  undertaking.<a name="NtA7_56" href="#Nt7_56"><sup>[56]</sup></a> Thus a
  fundamental antinomy manifested itself all through the development of
  astrology, which pretended to be an exact science, but always remained a
  sacerdotal theology.</p>

  <p>Of course, the more the idea of fatalism imposed itself and spread,
  the more the weight of this hopeless theory oppressed the consciousness.
  Man felt himself dominated and crushed by blind forces that dragged him
  on as irresistibly as they kept the celestial spheres in motion. His soul
  tried to escape the oppression of this cosmic mechanism, and to leave the
  slavery of <!-- Page 182 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page182"></a>[182]</span>Ananke. But he no longer had confidence in
  the ceremonies of his old religion. The new powers that had taken
  possession of heaven had to be propitiated by new means. The Oriental
  religions themselves offered a remedy against the evils they had created,
  and taught powerful and mysterious processes for conjuring fate.<a
  name="NtA7_57" href="#Nt7_57"><sup>[57]</sup></a> And side by side with
  astrology we see magic, a more pernicious aberration, gaining <span
  class="correction" title="text reads `gronud'">ground</span>.<a
  name="NtA7_58" href="#Nt7_58"><sup>[58]</sup></a></p>

<hr class="short" >

  <p>If, from the reading of Ptolemy's Tetrabiblos, we pass on to read a
  magic papyrus, our first impression is that we have stepped from one end
  of the intellectual world to the other. Here we find no trace of the
  systematic order or severe method that distinguish the work of the
  scholar of Alexandria. Of course, the doctrines of astrology are just as
  chimerical as those of magic, but they are deduced with an amount of
  logic, entirely wanting in works of sorcery, that compels reasoning
  intellects to accept them. Recipes borrowed from medicine and popular
  superstition, primitive practices rejected or abandoned by the sacerdotal
  rituals, beliefs repudiated by a progressive moral religion, plagiarisms
  and forgeries of literary or liturgic texts, incantations in which the
  gods of all barbarous nations are invoked in unintelligible gibberish,
  odd and disconcerting ceremonies&mdash;all these form a chaos in which
  the imagination loses itself, a potpourri in which an arbitrary
  syncretism seems to have attempted to create an inextricable
  confusion.</p>

  <p>However, if we observe more closely how magic operates, we find that
  it starts out from the same principles and acts along the same line of
  reasoning <!-- Page 183 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page183"></a>[183]</span>as astrology. Born during the same period
  in the primitive civilizations of the Orient, both were based on a number
  of common ideas.<a name="NtA7_59" href="#Nt7_59"><sup>[59]</sup></a>
  Magic, like astrology, proceeded from the principle of universal
  sympathy, yet it did not consider the relation existing between the stars
  traversing the heavens, and physical or moral phenomena, but the relation
  between whatever bodies there are. It started out from the preconceived
  idea that an obscure but constant relation exists between certain things,
  certain words, certain persons. This connection was established without
  hesitation between dead material things and living beings, because the
  primitive races ascribed a soul and existence similar to those of man, to
  everything surrounding them. The distinction between the three kingdoms
  of nature was unknown to them; they were "animists." The life of a person
  might, therefore, be linked to that of a thing, a tree, or an animal, in
  such a manner that one died if the other did, and that any damage
  suffered by one was also sustained by its inseparable associate.
  Sometimes the relation was founded on clearly intelligible grounds, like
  a resemblance between the thing and the being, as where, to kill an
  enemy, one pierced a waxen figure supposed to represent him. Or a
  contact, even merely passing by, was believed to have created
  indestructible affinities, for instance where the garments of an absent
  person were operated upon. Often, also, these imaginary relations were
  founded on reasons that escape us: like the qualities attributed by
  astrology to the stars, they may have been derived from old beliefs the
  memory of which is lost.</p>

  <p>Like astrology, then, magic was a science in some respects. First,
  like the predictions of its sister, it <!-- Page 184 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page184"></a>[184]</span>was partly based on
  observation&mdash;observation frequently rudimentary, superficial, hasty,
  and erroneous, but nevertheless important. It was an experimental
  discipline. Among the great number of facts noted by the curiosity of the
  magicians, there were many that received scientific indorsement later on.
  The attraction of the magnet for iron was utilized by the thaumaturgi
  before it was interpreted by the natural philosophers. In the vast
  compilations that circulated under the venerable names of Zoroaster or
  Hostanes, many fertile remarks were scattered among puerile ideas and
  absurd teachings, just as in the Greek treatises on alchemy that have
  come down to us. The idea that knowledge of the power of certain agents
  enables one to stimulate the hidden forces of the universe into action
  and to obtain extraordinary results, inspires the researches of physics
  to-day, just as it inspired the claims of magic. And if astrology was a
  perverted astronomy, magic was physics gone astray.</p>

  <p>Moreover, and again like astrology, magic was a science, because it
  started from the fundamental conception that order and law exist in
  nature, and that the same cause always produces the same effect. An
  occult ceremony, performed with the same care as an experiment in the
  chemical laboratory, will always have the expected result. To know the
  mysterious affinities that connect all things is sufficient to set the
  mechanism of the universe into motion. But the error of the magicians
  consisted in establishing a connection between phenomena that do not
  depend on each other at all. The act of exposing to the light for an
  instant a sensitive plate in a camera, then immersing it, according to
  given recipes, in appropriate liquids, and of making <!-- Page 185
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page185"></a>[185]</span>the picture of
  a relative or friend appear thereon, is a magical operation, but based on
  real actions and reactions, instead of on arbitrarily assumed sympathies
  and antipathies. Magic, therefore, was a science groping in the dark, and
  later became "a bastard sister of science," as Frazer puts it.</p>

  <p>But, like astrology, magic was religious in origin, and always
  remained a bastard sister of religion. Both grew up together in the
  temples of the barbarian Orient. Their practices were, at first, part of
  the dubious knowledge of fetichists who claimed to have control over the
  spirits that peopled nature and animated everything, and who claimed that
  they communicated with these spirits by means of rites known to
  themselves alone. Magic has been cleverly defined as "the strategy of
  animism."<a name="NtA7_60" href="#Nt7_60"><sup>[60]</sup></a> But, just
  as the growing power ascribed by the Chaldeans to the sidereal deities
  transformed the original astrology, so primitive sorcery assumed a
  different character when the world of the gods, conceived after the image
  of man, separated itself more and more from the realm of physical forces
  and became a realm of its own. This gave the mystic element which always
  entered the ceremonies, a new precision and development. By means of his
  charms, talismans, and exorcisms, the magician now communicated with the
  celestial or infernal "demons" and compelled them to obey him. But these
  spirits no longer opposed him with the blind resistance of matter
  animated by an uncertain kind of life; they were active and subtle beings
  having intelligence and will-power. Sometimes they took revenge for the
  slavery the magician attempted to impose on them and punished the
  audacious operator, who feared them, although <!-- Page 186 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page186"></a>[186]</span>invoking their aid.
  Thus the incantation often assumed the shape of a prayer addressed to a
  power stronger than man, and magic became a religion. Its rites developed
  side by side with the canonical liturgies, and frequently encroached on
  them.<a name="NtA7_61" href="#Nt7_61"><sup>[61]</sup></a> The only
  barrier between them was the vague and constantly shifting borderline
  that limits the neighboring domains of religion and superstition.</p>

<hr class="short" >

  <p>This half scientific, half religious magic, with its books and its
  professional adepts, is of Oriental origin. The old Grecian and Italian
  sorcery appears to have been rather mild. Conjurations to avert
  hail-storms, or formulas to draw rain, evil charms to render fields
  barren or to kill cattle, love philters and rejuvenating salves, old
  women's remedies, talismans against the evil eye,&mdash;all are based on
  popular superstition and kept in existence by folk-lore and charlatanism.
  Even the witches of Thessaly, whom people credited with the power of
  making the moon descend from the sky, were botanists more than anything
  else, acquainted with the marvelous virtues of medicinal plants. The
  terror that the necromancers inspired was due, to a considerable extent,
  to the use they made of the old belief in ghosts. They exploited the
  superstitious belief in ghost-power and slipped metal tablets covered
  with execrations into graves, to bring misfortune or death to some enemy.
  But neither in Greece nor in Italy is there any trace of a coherent
  system of doctrines, of an occult and learned discipline, nor of any
  sacerdotal instruction.</p>

  <p>Originally the adepts in this dubious art were <!-- Page 187 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page187"></a>[187]</span>despised. As late as
  the period of Augustus they were generally equivocal beggar-women who
  plied their miserable trade in the lowest quarters of the slums. But with
  the invasion of the Oriental religions the magician began to receive more
  consideration, and his condition improved.<a name="NtA7_62"
  href="#Nt7_62"><sup>[62]</sup></a> He was honored, and feared even more.
  During the second century scarcely anybody would have doubted his power
  to call up divine apparitions, converse with the superior spirits and
  even translate himself bodily into the heavens.<a name="NtA7_63"
  href="#Nt7_63"><sup>[63]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Here the victorious progress of the Oriental religions shows itself.
  The Egyptian ritual<a name="NtA7_64" href="#Nt7_64"><sup>[64]</sup></a>
  originally was nothing but a collection of magical practices, properly
  speaking. The religious community imposed its will upon the gods by means
  of prayers or even threats. The gods were compelled to obey the
  officiating priest, if the liturgy was correctly performed, and if the
  incantations and the magic words were pronounced with the right
  intonation. The well-informed priest had an almost unlimited power over
  all supernatural beings on land, in the water, in the air, in heaven and
  in hell. Nowhere was the gulf between things human and things divine
  smaller, nowhere was the increasing differentiation that separated magic
  from religion less advanced. Until the end of paganism they remained so
  closely associated that it is sometimes difficult to distinguish the
  texts of one from those of the other.</p>

  <p>The Chaldeans<a name="NtA7_65" href="#Nt7_65"><sup>[65]</sup></a> also
  were past masters of sorcery, well versed in the knowledge of presages
  and experts in conjuring the evils which the presages foretold. In
  Mesopotamia, where they were confidential advisers of the kings, the
  magicians belonged to the official <!-- Page 188 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page188"></a>[188]</span>clergy; they invoked
  the aid of the state gods in their incantations, and their sacred science
  was as highly esteemed as haruspicy in Etruria. The immense prestige that
  continued to surround it, assured its persistence after the fall of
  Nineveh and Babylon. Its tradition was still alive under the Cæsars, and
  a number of enchanters rightly or wrongly claimed to possess the ancient
  wisdom of Chaldea.<a name="NtA7_66"
  href="#Nt7_66"><sup>[66]</sup></a></p>

  <p>And the thaumaturgus, who was supposed to be the heir of the archaic
  priests, assumed a wholly sacerdotal appearance at Rome. Being an
  inspired sage who received confidential communications from heavenly
  spirits, he gave to his life and to his appearance a dignity almost equal
  to that of the philosopher. The common people soon confused the two,<a
  name="NtA7_67" href="#Nt7_67"><sup>[67]</sup></a> and the Orientalizing
  philosophy of the last period of paganism actually accepted and justified
  all the superstitions of magic. Neo-Platonism, which concerned itself to
  a large extent with demonology, leaned more and more towards theurgy, and
  was finally completely absorbed by it.</p>

  <p>But the ancients expressly distinguished, "magic," which was always
  under suspicion and disapproved of, from the legitimate and honorable art
  for which the name "theurgy"<a name="NtA7_68"
  href="#Nt7_68"><sup>[68]</sup></a> was invented. The term "magician,"
  <span class="extra" title="moved from footnote">(<span title="magos"
  class="grk">&mu;&#x1F71;&gamma;&omicron;&sigmaf;</span>)</span> which
  applied to all performers of miracles, properly means the priests of
  Mazdaism, and a well attested tradition makes the Persians<a
  name="NtA7_69" href="#Nt7_69"><sup>[69]</sup></a> the authors of the real
  magic, that called "black magic" by the Middle Ages. If they did not
  invent it&mdash;because it is as old as humanity&mdash;they were at least
  the first to place it upon a doctrinal foundation and to assign to it a
  place <!-- Page 189 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page189"></a>[189]</span>in a clearly formulated theological
  system. The Mazdean dualism gave a new power to this pernicious knowledge
  by conferring upon it the character that will distinguish it
  henceforth.</p>

  <p>Under what influences did the Persian magic come into existence? When
  and how did it spread? These are questions that are not well elucidated
  yet. The intimate fusion of the religious doctrines of the Iranian
  conquerors with those of the native clergy, which took place at Babylon,
  occurred in this era of belief,<a name="NtA7_70"
  href="#Nt7_70"><sup>[70]</sup></a> and the magicians that were
  established in Mesopotamia combined their secret traditions with the
  rites and formulas codified by the Chaldean sorcerers. The universal
  curiosity of the Greeks soon took note of this marvelous science.
  Naturalist philosophers like Democritus,<a name="NtA7_71"
  href="#Nt7_71"><sup>[71]</sup></a> the great traveler, seem to have
  helped themselves more than once from the treasure of observations
  collected by the Oriental priests. Without a doubt they drew from these
  incongruous compilations, in which truth was mingled with the absurd and
  reality with the fantastical, the knowledge of some properties of plants
  and minerals, or of some experiments of physics. However, the limpid
  Hellenic genius always turned away from the misty speculations of magic,
  giving them but slight consideration. But towards the end of the
  Alexandrine period the books ascribed to the half-mythical masters of the
  Persian science, Zoroaster, Hostanes and Hystaspes, were translated into
  Greek, and until the end of paganism those names enjoyed a prodigious
  authority. At the same time the Jews, who were acquainted with the arcana
  of the Irano-Chaldean doctrines and proceedings, made some of the recipes
  known wherever the dispersion brought <!-- Page 190 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page190"></a>[190]</span>them.<a name="NtA7_72"
  href="#Nt7_72"><sup>[72]</sup></a> Later, a more immediate influence was
  exercised upon the Roman world by the Persian colonies of Asia Minor,<a
  name="NtA7_73" href="#Nt7_73"><sup>[73]</sup></a> who retained an
  obstinate faith in their ancient national beliefs.</p>

  <p>The particular importance attributed to magic by the Mazdeans is a
  necessary consequence of their dualist system, which has been treated by
  us before.<a name="NtA7_74" href="#Nt7_74"><sup>[74]</sup></a> Ormuzd,
  residing in the heavens of light, is opposed by his irreconcilable
  adversary, Ahriman, ruler of the underworld. The one stands for light,
  truth, and goodness, the other for darkness, falsehood, and perversity.
  The one commands the kind spirits which protect the pious believer, the
  other is master over demons whose malice causes all the evils that
  afflict humanity. These opposite principles fight for the domination of
  the earth, and each creates favorable or noxious animals and plants.
  Everything on earth is either heavenly or infernal. Ahriman and his
  demons, who surround man to tempt or hurt him,<a name="NtA7_75"
  href="#Nt7_75"><sup>[75]</sup></a> are evil gods and entirely different
  from those of which Ormuzd's host consists. The magician sacrifices to
  them, either to avert evils they threaten, or to direct their ire against
  enemies of true belief, and the impure spirits rejoice in bloody
  immolations and delight in the fumes of flesh burning on the altars.<a
  name="NtA7_76" href="#Nt7_76"><sup>[76]</sup></a> Terrible acts and words
  attended all immolations. Plutarch<a name="NtA7_77"
  href="#Nt7_77"><sup>[77]</sup></a> mentions an example of the dark
  sacrifices of the Mazdeans. "In a mortar," he says, "they pound a certain
  herb called wild garlic, at the same time invoking Hades (Ahriman), and
  the powers of darkness, then stirring this herb in the blood of a
  slaughtered wolf, they take it away and drop it on a spot never reached
  by the rays of the sun." A necromantic performance indeed. <!-- Page 191
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page191"></a>[191]</span></p>

  <p>We can imagine the new strength which such a conception of the
  universe must have given to magic. It was no longer an incongruous
  collection of popular superstitions and scientific observations. It
  became a reversed religion: its nocturnal rites were the dreadful liturgy
  of the infernal powers. There was no miracle the experienced magician
  might not expect to perform with the aid of the demons, providing he know
  how to master them; he would invent any atrocity in his desire to gain
  the favor of the evil divinities whom crime gratified and suffering
  pleased. Hence the number of impious practices performed in the dark,
  practices the horror of which is equaled only by their absurdity:
  preparing beverages that disturbed the senses and impaired the intellect;
  mixing subtle poisons extracted from demoniac plants and corpses already
  in a state of putridity;<a name="NtA7_78"
  href="#Nt7_78"><sup>[78]</sup></a> immolating children in order to read
  the future in their quivering entrails or to conjure up ghosts. All the
  satanic refinement that a perverted imagination in a state of insanity
  could conceive<a name="NtA7_79" href="#Nt7_79"><sup>[79]</sup></a>
  pleased the malicious evil spirits; the more odious the monstrosity, the
  more assured was its efficacy. These abominable practices were sternly
  suppressed by the Roman government. Whereas, in the case of an astrologer
  who had committed an open transgression, the law was satisfied with
  expelling him from Rome&mdash;whither he generally soon
  returned,&mdash;the magician was put in the same class with murderers and
  poisoners, and was subjected to the very severest punishment. He was
  nailed to the cross or thrown to the wild beasts. Not only the practice
  of the profession, but even the simple fact of possessing works of
  sorcery made any one subject to prosecution.<a name="NtA7_80"
  href="#Nt7_80"><sup>[80]</sup></a> <!-- Page 192 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page192"></a>[192]</span></p>

  <p>However, there are ways of reaching an agreement with the police, and
  in this case custom was stronger than law. The intermittent rigor of
  imperial edicts had no more power to destroy an inveterate superstition
  than the Christian polemics had to cure it. It was a recognition of its
  strength when state and church united to fight it. Neither reached the
  root of the evil, for they did not deny the reality of the power wielded
  by the sorcerers. As long as it was admitted that malicious spirits
  constantly interfered in human affairs, and that there were secret means
  enabling the operator to dominate those spirits or to share in their
  power, magic was indestructible. It appealed to too many human passions
  to remain unheard. If, on the one hand, the desire of penetrating the
  mysteries of the future, the fear of unknown misfortunes, and hope,
  always reviving, led the anxious masses to seek a chimerical certainty in
  astrology, on the other hand, in the case of magic, the blinding charm of
  the marvelous, the entreaties of love and ambition, the bitter desire for
  revenge, the fascination of crime, and the intoxication of
  bloodshed,&mdash;all the instincts that are not avowable and that are
  satisfied in the dark, took turns in practising their seductions. During
  the entire life of the Roman empire its existence continued, and the very
  mystery that it was compelled to hide in increased its prestige and
  almost gave it the authority of a revelation.</p>

  <p>A curious occurrence that took place towards the end of the fifth
  century at Beirut, in Syria, shows how deeply even the strongest
  intellects of that period believed in the most atrocious practices of
  magic. One night some students of the famous law-school of that <!-- Page
  193 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page193"></a>[193]</span>city
  attempted to kill a slave in the circus, to aid the master in obtaining
  the favor of a woman who scorned him. Being reported, they had to deliver
  up their hidden volumes, of which those of Zoroaster and of Hostanes were
  found, together with those written by the astrologer Manetho. The whole
  city was agitated, and searches proved that many young men preferred the
  study of the illicit science to that of Roman law. By order of the bishop
  a solemn auto-da-fé was made of all this literature, in the presence of
  the city officials and the clergy, and the most revolting passages were
  read in public, "in order to acquaint everybody with the conceited and
  vain promises of the demons," as the pious writer of the story says.<a
  name="NtA7_81" href="#Nt7_81"><sup>[81]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Thus the ancient traditions of magic continued to live in the
  Christian Orient after the fall of paganism. They even outlived the
  domination of the church. The rigorous principles of its monotheism
  notwithstanding, Islam became infected with those Persian superstitions.
  In the Occident the evil art resisted persecution and anathemas with the
  same obstinacy as in the Orient. It remained alive in Rome all through
  the fifth century,<a name="NtA7_82" href="#Nt7_82"><sup>[82]</sup></a>
  and when scientific astrology in Europe went down with science itself,
  the old Mazdean dualism continued to manifest itself, during the entire
  Middle Ages in the ceremonies of the black mass and the worshiping of
  Satan, until the dawn of the modern era.</p>

<hr class="short" >

  <p>Twin sisters, born of the superstitions of the learned Orient, magic
  and astrology always remained the hybrid daughters of sacerdotal culture.
  Their existence <!-- Page 194 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page194"></a>[194]</span>was governed by two contrary principles,
  reason and faith, and they never ceased to fluctuate between these two
  poles of thought. Both were inspired by a belief in universal sympathy,
  according to which occult and powerful relations exist between human
  beings and dead objects, all possessing a mysterious life. The doctrine
  of sidereal influences, combined with a knowledge of the immutability of
  the celestial revolutions, caused astrology to formulate the first theory
  of absolute fatalism, whose decrees might be known beforehand. But,
  besides this rigorous determinism, it retained its childhood faith in the
  divine stars, whose favor could be secured and malignity avoided through
  worship. In astrology the experimental method was reduced to the
  completing of prognostics based on the supposed character of the stellar
  gods.</p>

  <p>Magic also remained half empirical and half religious. Like our
  physics, it was based on observation, it proclaimed the constancy of the
  laws of nature, and sought to conquer the latent energies of the material
  world in order to bring them under the dominion of man's will. But at the
  same time it recognized, in the powers that it claimed to conquer,
  spirits or demons whose protection might be obtained, whose ill-will
  might be appeased, or whose savage hostility might be unchained by means
  of immolations and incantations.</p>

  <p>All their aberrations notwithstanding, astrology and magic were not
  entirely fruitless. Their counterfeit learning has been a genuine help to
  the progress of human knowledge. Because they awakened chimerical hopes
  and fallacious ambitions in the minds of their adepts, researches were
  undertaken which undoubtedly <!-- Page 195 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page195"></a>[195]</span>would never have been started or persisted
  in for the sake of a disinterested love of truth. The observations,
  collected with untiring patience by the Oriental priests, caused the
  first physical and astronomical discoveries, and, as in the time of the
  scholastics, the occult sciences led to the exact ones. But when these
  understood the vanity of the astounding illusions on which astrology and
  magic had subsisted, they broke up the foundation of the arts to which
  they owed their birth.</p>

<h3>THE TRANSFORMATION OF ROMAN PAGANISM.</h3>

  <p>About the time of the Severi the religion of Europe must have
  presented an aspect of surprising variety. Although dethroned, the old
  native Italian, Celtic and Iberian divinities were still alive. Though
  eclipsed by foreign rivals, they lived on in the devotion of the lower
  classes and in the traditions of the rural districts. For a long time the
  Roman gods had been established in every town and had received the homage
  of an official clergy according to pontifical rites. Beside them,
  however, were installed the representatives of all the Asiatic pantheons,
  and these received the most fervent adoration from the masses. New powers
  had arrived from Asia Minor, Egypt, Syria, and the dazzling Oriental sun
  outshone the stars of Italy's temperate sky. All forms of paganism were
  simultaneously received and retained while the exclusive monotheism of
  the Jews kept its adherents, and Christianity strengthened its churches
  and fortified its orthodoxy, at the same time giving birth to the
  baffling vagaries of gnosticism. A hundred different currents carried
  away hesitating and undecided minds, a hundred contrasting sermons made
  appeals to the conscience of the people.</p>

  <p>Let us suppose that in modern Europe the faithful <!-- Page 197
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page197"></a>[197]</span>had deserted
  the Christian churches to worship Allah or Brahma, to follow the precepts
  of Confucius or Buddha, or to adopt the maxims of the Shinto; let us
  imagine a great confusion of all the races of the world in which Arabian
  mullahs, Chinese scholars, Japanese bonzes, Tibetan lamas and Hindu
  pundits would be preaching fatalism and predestination, ancestor-worship
  and devotion to a deified sovereign, pessimism and deliverance through
  annihilation&mdash;a confusion in which all those priests would erect
  temples of exotic architecture in our cities and celebrate their
  disparate rites therein. Such a dream, which the future may perhaps
  realize, would offer a pretty accurate picture of the religious chaos in
  which the ancient world was struggling before the reign of
  Constantine.</p>

  <p>The Oriental religions that successively gained popularity exercised a
  decisive influence on the transformation of Latin paganism. Asia Minor
  was the first to have its gods accepted by Italy. Since the end of the
  Punic wars the black stone symbolizing the Great Mother of Pessinus had
  been established on the Palatine, but only since the reign of Claudius
  could the Phrygian cult freely develop in all its splendor and excesses.
  It introduced a sensual, highly-colored and fanatical worship into the
  grave and somber religion of the Romans. Officially recognized, it
  attracted and took under its protection other foreign divinities from
  Anatolia and assimilated them to Cybele and Attis, who thereafter bore
  the symbols of several deities together. Cappadocian, Jewish, Persian and
  even Christian influences modified the old rites of Pessinus and filled
  them with ideas of spiritual purification and <!-- Page 198 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page198"></a>[198]</span>eternal redemption by
  the bloody baptism of the taurobolium. But the priests did not succeed in
  eliminating the basis of coarse naturism which ancient barbaric tradition
  had imposed upon them.</p>

  <p>Beginning with the second century before our era, the mysteries of
  Isis and Serapis spread over Italy with the Alexandrian culture whose
  religious expression they were, and in spite of all persecution
  established themselves at Rome where Caligula gave them the freedom of
  the city. They did not bring with them a very advanced theological
  system, because Egypt never produced anything but a chaotic aggregate of
  disparate doctrines, nor a very elevated ethics, because the level of its
  morality&mdash;that of the Alexandrian Greeks&mdash;rose but slowly from
  a low stage. But they made Italy, and later the other Latin provinces,
  familiar with an ancient ritual of incomparable charm that aroused widely
  different feelings with its splendid processions and liturgic dramas.
  They also gave their votaries positive assurance of a blissful
  immortality after death, when they would be united with Serapis and,
  participating body and soul in his divinity, would live in eternal
  contemplation of the gods.</p>

  <p>At a somewhat later period arrived the numerous and varied Baals of
  Syria. The great economic movement starting at the beginning of our era
  which produced the colonization of the Latin world by Syrian slaves and
  merchants, not only modified the material civilization of Europe, but
  also its conceptions and beliefs. The Semitic cults entered into
  successful competition with those of Asia Minor and Egypt. They may not
  have had so stirring a liturgy, nor have been so thoroughly absorbed in
  preoccupation with a future <!-- Page 199 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page199"></a>[199]</span>life, although they taught an original
  eschatology, but they did have an infinitely higher idea of divinity. The
  Chaldean astrology, of which the Syrian priests were enthusiastic
  disciples, had furnished them with the elements of a scientific theology.
  It had led them to the notion of a God residing far from the earth above
  the zone of the stars, a God almighty, universal and eternal. Everything
  on earth was determined by the revolutions of the heavens according to
  infinite cycles of years. It had taught them at the same time the worship
  of the sun, the radiant source of earthly life and human
  intelligence.</p>

  <p>The learned doctrines of the Babylonians had also imposed themselves
  upon the Persian mysteries of Mithra which considered time identified
  with heaven as the supreme cause, and deified the stars; but they had
  superimposed themselves upon the ancient Mazdean creed without destroying
  it. Thus the essential principles of the religion of Iran, the secular
  and often successful rival of Greece, penetrated into the Occident under
  cover of Chaldean wisdom. The Mithra worship, the last and highest
  manifestation of ancient paganism, had Persian dualism for its
  fundamental dogma. The world is the scene and the stake of a contest
  between good and evil, Ormuzd and Ahriman, gods and demons, and from this
  primary conception of the universe flowed a strong and pure system of
  ethics. Life is a combat; soldiers under the command of Mithra,
  invincible heroes of the faith, must ceaselessly oppose the undertakings
  of the infernal powers which sow corruption broadcast. This imperative
  ethics was productive of energy and formed the characteristic <!-- Page
  200 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page200"></a>[200]</span>feature
  distinguishing Mithraism from all other Oriental cults.</p>

  <p>Thus every one of the Levantine countries&mdash;and that is what we
  meant to show in this brief recapitulation&mdash;had enriched Roman
  paganism with new beliefs that were frequently destined to outlive it.
  What was the result of this confusion of heterogeneous doctrines whose
  multiplicity was extreme and whose values were very different? How did
  the barbaric ideas refine themselves and combine with each other when
  thrown into the fiery crucible of imperial syncretism? In other words,
  what shape was assumed by ancient idolatry, so impregnated with exotic
  theories during the fourth century, when it was finally dethroned? It is
  this point that we should like to indicate briefly as the conclusion to
  these studies.</p>

  <p>However, can we speak of <i>one</i> pagan religion? Did not the
  blending of the races result in multiplying the variety of disagreements?
  Had not the confused collision of creeds produced a division into
  fragments, a communication of churches? Had not a complacent syncretism
  engendered a multiplication of sects? The "Hellenes," as Themistius told
  the Emperor Valens, had three hundred ways of conceiving and honoring
  deity, who takes pleasure in such diversity of homage.<a name="NtA8_1"
  href="#Nt8_1"><sup>[1]</sup></a> In paganism a cult does not die
  violently, but after long decay. A new doctrine does not necessarily
  displace an older one. They may co-exist for a long time as contrary
  possibilities suggested by the intellect or faith, and all opinions, all
  practices, seem respectable to paganism. It never has any radical or
  revolutionary transformations. Undoubtedly, the pagan beliefs of the
  fourth century or earlier did not <!-- Page 201 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page201"></a>[201]</span>have the consistency of
  a metaphysical system nor the rigor of canons formulated by a council.
  There is always a considerable difference between the faith of the masses
  and that of cultured minds, and this difference was bound to be great in
  an aristocratic empire whose social classes were sharply separated. The
  devotion of the masses was as unchanging as the depths of the sea; it was
  not stirred up nor heated by the upper currents.<a name="NtA8_2"
  href="#Nt8_2"><sup>[2]</sup></a> The peasants practised their pious rites
  over anointed stones, sacred springs and blossoming trees, as in the
  past, and continued celebrating their rustic holidays during seed-time
  and harvest. They adhered with invincible tenacity to their traditional
  usages. Degraded and lowered to the rank of superstitions, these were
  destined to persist for centuries under the Christian orthodoxy without
  exposing it to serious peril, and while they were no longer marked in the
  liturgic calendars they were still mentioned occasionally in the
  collections of folk-lore.</p>

  <p>At the other extreme of society the philosophers delighted in veiling
  religion with the frail and brilliant tissue of their speculations. Like
  the emperor Julian they improvised bold and incongruous interpretations
  of the myth of the Great Mother, and these interpretations were received
  and relished by a restricted circle of scholars. But during the fourth
  century these vagaries of the individual imagination were nothing but
  arbitrary applications of uncontested principles. During that century
  there was much less intellectual anarchy than when Lucian had exposed the
  sects "for sale at public auction"; a comparative harmony arose among the
  pagans after they joined the opposition. One single school, that of
  neo-Platonism, ruled all <!-- Page 202 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page202"></a>[202]</span>minds. This school not only respected
  positive religion, as ancient stoicism had done, but venerated it,
  because it saw there the expression of an old revelation handed down by
  past generations. It considered the sacred books divinely
  inspired&mdash;the books of Hermes Trismegistus, Orpheus, the Chaldean
  oracles, Homer, and especially the esoteric doctrines of the
  mysteries&mdash;and subordinated its theories to their teachings. As
  there must be no contradiction between all the disparate traditions of
  different countries and different periods, because all have emanated from
  one divinity, philosophy, the <i>ancilla theologiae</i>, attempted to
  reconcile them by the aid of allegory. And thus, by means of compromises
  between old Oriental ideas and Greco-Latin thought, an <i>ensemble</i> of
  beliefs slowly took form, the truth of which seemed to have been
  established by common consent. So when the atrophied parts of the Roman
  religion had been removed, foreign elements had combined to give it a new
  vigor and in it themselves became modified. This hidden work of internal
  decomposition and reconstruction had unconsciously produced a religion
  very different from the one Augustus had attempted to restore.</p>

  <p>However, we would be tempted to believe that there had been no change
  in the Roman faith, were we to read certain authors that fought idolatry
  in those days. Saint Augustine, for instance, in his <i>City of God</i>,
  pleasantly pokes fun at the multitude of Italian gods that presided over
  the paltriest acts of life.<a name="NtA8_3"
  href="#Nt8_3"><sup>[3]</sup></a> But the useless, ridiculous deities of
  the old pontifical litanies no longer existed outside of the books of
  antiquaries. As a matter of fact, the Christian polemicist's authority in
  this instance was Varro. The defenders of the <!-- Page 203 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page203"></a>[203]</span>church sought weapons
  against idolatry even in Xenophanes, the first philosopher to oppose
  Greek polytheism. It has frequently been shown that apologists find it
  difficult to follow the progress of the doctrines which they oppose, and
  often their blows fall upon dead men. Moreover, it is a fault common to
  all scholars, to all imbued with book learning, that they are better
  acquainted with the opinions of ancient authors than with the sentiments
  of their contemporaries, and that they prefer to live in the past rather
  than in the world surrounding them. It was easier to reproduce the
  objections of the Epicureans and the skeptics against abolished beliefs,
  than to study the defects of an active organism with a view to
  criticizing it. In those times the merely formal culture of the schools
  caused many of the best minds to lose their sense of reality.</p>

  <p>The Christian polemics therefore frequently give us an inadequate idea
  of paganism in its decline. When they complacently insisted upon the
  immorality of the sacred legends they ignored the fact that the gods and
  heroes of mythology had no longer any but a purely literary existence.<a
  name="NtA8_4" href="#Nt8_4"><sup>[4]</sup></a> The writers of that
  period, like those of the Renaissance, regarded the fictions of mythology
  as details necessary to poetical composition. They were ornaments of
  style, rhetorical devices, but not the expression of a sincere faith.
  Those old myths had fallen to the lowest degree of disrepute in the
  theater. The actors of mimes ridiculing Jupiter's gallant adventures did
  not believe in their reality any more than the author of Faust believed
  in the compact with Mephistopheles.</p>

  <p>So we must not be deceived by the oratorical effects <!-- Page 204
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page204"></a>[204]</span>of a
  rhetorician like Arnobius or by the Ciceronian periods of a Lactantius.
  In order to ascertain the real status of the beliefs we must refer to
  Christian authors who were men of letters less than they were men of
  action, who lived the life of the people and breathed the air of the
  streets, and who spoke from experience rather than from the treatises of
  mythmongers. They were high functionaries like Prudentius;<a
  name="NtA8_5" href="#Nt8_5"><sup>[5]</sup></a> like the man to whom the
  name "Ambrosiaster"<a name="NtA8_6" href="#Nt8_6"><sup>[6]</sup></a> has
  been given since the time of Erasmus; like the converted pagan Firmicus
  Maternus,<a name="NtA8_7" href="#Nt8_7"><sup>[7]</sup></a> who had
  written a treatise on astrology before opposing "The Error of the Profane
  Religions"; like certain priests brought into contact with the last
  adherents of idolatry through their pastoral duties, as for instance the
  author of the homilies ascribed to St. Maximus of Turin;<a name="NtA8_8"
  href="#Nt8_8"><sup>[8]</sup></a> finally like the writers of anonymous
  pamphlets, works prepared for the particular occasion and breathing the
  ardor of all the passions of the movement.<a name="NtA8_9"
  href="#Nt8_9"><sup>[9]</sup></a> If this inquiry is based on the obscure
  indications in regard to their religious convictions left by members of
  the Roman aristocracy who remained true to the faith of their ancestors,
  like Macrobius or Symmachus; if it is particularly guided by the
  exceptionally numerous inscriptions that seem to be the public expression
  of the last will of expiring paganism, we shall be able to gain a
  sufficiently precise idea of the condition of the Roman religion at the
  time of its extinction.</p>

  <p>One fact becomes immediately clear from an examination of those
  documents. The old national religion of Rome was dead.<a name="NtA8_10"
  href="#Nt8_10"><sup>[10]</sup></a> The great dignitaries still adorned
  themselves with the titles of augur and quindecimvir, or of consul and
  tribune, but those <!-- Page 205 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page205"></a>[205]</span>archaic prelacies were as devoid of all
  real influence upon religion as the republican magistracies were
  powerless in the state. Their fall had been made complete on the day when
  Aurelian established the pontiffs of the Invincible Sun, the protector of
  his empire, beside and above the ancient high priests. The only cults
  still alive were those of the Orient, and against them were directed the
  efforts of the Christian polemics, who grew more and more bitter in
  speaking of them. The barbarian gods had taken the place of the defunct
  immortals in the devotion of the pagans. They alone still had empire over
  the soul.</p>

  <p>With all the other "profane religions," Firmicus Maternus fought those
  of the four Oriental nations. He connected them with the four elements.
  The Egyptians were the worshipers of water&mdash;the water of the Nile
  fertilizing their country; the Phrygians of the earth, which was to them
  the Great Mother of everything; the Syrians and Carthaginians of the air,
  which they adored under the name of celestial Juno;<a name="NtA8_11"
  href="#Nt8_11"><sup>[11]</sup></a> the Persians of fire, to which they
  attributed preeminence over the other three principles. This system
  certainly was borrowed from the pagan theologians. In the common peril
  threatening them, those cults, formerly rivals, had become reconciled and
  regarded themselves as divisions and, so to speak, congregations, of the
  same church. Each one of them was especially consecrated to one of the
  elements which in combination form the universe. Their union constituted
  the pantheistic religion of the deified world.</p>

  <p>All the Oriental religions assumed the form of mysteries.<a
  name="NtA8_12" href="#Nt8_12"><sup>[12]</sup></a> Their dignitaries were
  at the same time pontiffs of the Invincible Sun, fathers of Mithra, <!--
  Page 206 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page206"></a>[206]</span>celebrants of the taurobolium of the Great
  Mother, prophets of Isis; in short, they had all titles imaginable. In
  their initiation they received the revelation of an esoteric doctrine
  strengthened by their fervor.<a name="NtA8_13"
  href="#Nt8_13"><sup>[13]</sup></a> What was the theology they learned?
  Here also a certain dogmatic homogeneity has established itself.</p>

  <p>All writers agree with Firmicus that the pagans worshiped the
  <i>elementa</i>.<a name="NtA8_14" href="#Nt8_14"><sup>[14]</sup></a>
  Under this term were included not only the four simple substances which
  by their opposition and blending caused all phenomena of the visible
  world,<a name="NtA8_15" href="#Nt8_15"><sup>[15]</sup></a> but also the
  stars and in general the elements of all celestial and earthly bodies.<a
  name="NtA8_16" href="#Nt8_16"><sup>[16]</sup></a></p>

  <p>We therefore may in a certain sense speak of the return of paganism to
  nature worship; but must this transformation be regarded as a
  retrogression toward a barbarous past, as a relapse to the level of
  primitive animism? If so, we should be deceived by appearances. Religions
  do not fall back into infancy as they grow old. The pagans of the fourth
  century no longer naively considered their gods as capricious genii, as
  the disordered powers of a confused natural philosophy; they conceived
  them as cosmic energies whose providential action was regulated in a
  harmonious system. Faith was no longer instinctive and impulsive, for
  erudition and reflection had reconstructed the entire theology. In a
  certain sense it might be said that theology had passed from the
  fictitious to the metaphysical state, according to the formula of Comte.
  It was intimately connected with the knowledge of the day, which was
  cherished by its last votaries with love and pride, as faithful heirs of
  the ancient wisdom of the Orient and Greece.<a name="NtA8_17"
  href="#Nt8_17"><sup>[17]</sup></a> In many instances it was nothing but a
  religious form of the cosmology of the <!-- Page 207 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page207"></a>[207]</span>period. This
  constituted both its strength and its weakness. The rigorous principles
  of astrology determined its conception of heaven and earth.</p>

  <p>The universe was an organism animated by a God, unique, eternal and
  almighty. Sometimes this God was identified with the destiny that ruled
  all things, with infinite time that regulated all visible phenomena, and
  he was worshiped in each subdivision of that endless duration, especially
  in the months and the seasons.<a name="NtA8_18"
  href="#Nt8_18"><sup>[18]</sup></a> Sometimes, however, he was compared
  with a king; he was thought of as a sovereign governing an empire, and
  the various gods then were the princes and dignitaries interceding with
  the rulers on behalf of his subjects whom they led in some manner into
  his presence. This heavenly court had its messengers or "angels"
  conveying to men the will of the master and reporting again the vows and
  petitions of his subjects. It was an aristocratic monarchy in heaven as
  on earth.<a name="NtA8_19" href="#Nt8_19"><sup>[19]</sup></a> A more
  philosophic conception made the divinity an infinite power impregnating
  all nature with its overflowing forces. "There is only one God, sole and
  supreme," wrote Maximus of Madaura about 390, "without beginning or
  parentage, whose energies, diffused through the world, we invoke under
  various names, because we are ignorant of his real name. By successively
  addressing our supplications to his different members we intend to honor
  him in his entirety. Through the mediation of the subordinate gods the
  common father both of themselves and of all men is honored in a thousand
  different ways by mortals who are thus in accord in spite of their
  discord."<a name="NtA8_20" href="#Nt8_20"><sup>[20]</sup></a></p>

  <p>However, this ineffable God, who comprehensively embraces everything,
  manifests himself especially in <!-- Page 208 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page208"></a>[208]</span>the resplendent brightness of the ethereal
  sky.<a name="NtA8_21" href="#Nt8_21"><sup>[21]</sup></a> He reveals his
  power in water and in fire, in the earth, the sea and the blowing of the
  winds; but his purest, most radiant and most active epiphany is in the
  stars whose revolutions determine every event and all our actions. Above
  all he manifests himself in the sun, the motive power of the celestial
  spheres, the inexhaustible seat of light and life, the creator of all
  intelligence on earth. Certain philosophers like the senator
  Praetextatus, one of the <i>dramatis personae</i> of Macrobius,
  confounded all the ancient divinities of paganism with the sun in a
  thorough-going syncretism.<a name="NtA8_22"
  href="#Nt8_22"><sup>[22]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Just as a superficial observation might lead to the belief that the
  theology of the last pagans had reverted to its origin, so at first sight
  the transformation of the ritual might appear like a return to savagery.
  With the adoption of the Oriental mysteries barbarous, cruel and obscene
  practices were undoubtedly spread, as for instance the masquerading in
  the guise of animals in the Mithraic initiations, the bloody dances of
  the <i>galli</i> of the Great Mother and the mutilations of the Syrian
  priests. Nature worship was originally as "amoral" as nature itself. But
  an ethereal spiritualism ideally transfigured the coarseness of those
  primitive customs. Just as the doctrine had become completely impregnated
  with philosophy and erudition, so the liturgy had become saturated with
  ethical ideas.</p>

  <p>The taurobolium, a disgusting shower-bath of lukewarm blood, had
  become a means of obtaining a new and eternal life; the ritualistic
  ablutions were no longer external and material acts, but were supposed to
  cleanse the soul of its impurities and to restore its original innocence;
  the sacred repasts <!-- Page 209 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page209"></a>[209]</span>imparted an intimate virtue to the soul
  and furnished sustenance to the spiritual life. While efforts were made
  to maintain the continuity of tradition, its content had slowly been
  transformed. The most shocking and licentious fables were metamorphosed
  into edifying narratives by convenient and subtle interpretations which
  were a joy to the learned mythographers. Paganism had become a school of
  morality, the priest a doctor and director of the conscience.<a
  name="NtA8_23" href="#Nt8_23"><sup>[23]</sup></a></p>

  <p>The purity and holiness imparted by the practice of sacred ceremonies
  were the indispensable condition for obtaining eternal life.<a
  name="NtA8_24" href="#Nt8_24"><sup>[24]</sup></a> The mysteries promised
  a blessed immortality to their initiates, and claimed to reveal to them
  infallible means of effecting their salvation. According to a generally
  accepted symbol, the spirit animating man was a spark, detached from the
  fires shining in the ether; it partook of their divinity and so, it was
  believed, had descended to the earth to undergo a trial. It could
  literally be said that</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Man is a fallen god who still remembers heaven."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>After having left their corporeal prisons, the pious souls reascended
  towards the celestial regions of the divine stars, to live forever in
  endless brightness beyond the starry spheres.<a name="NtA8_25"
  href="#Nt8_25"><sup>[25]</sup></a></p>

  <p>But at the other extremity of the world, facing this luminous realm,
  extended the somber kingdom of evil spirits. They were irreconcilable
  adversaries of the gods and men of good will, and constantly left the
  infernal regions to roam about the earth and scatter evil. With the aid
  of the celestial spirits, the faithful had to struggle forever against
  their designs and seek to avert their anger by means of bloody
  sacrifices. <!-- Page 210 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page210"></a>[210]</span>But, with the help of occult and terrible
  processes, the magician could subject them to his power and compel them
  to serve his purposes. This demonology, the monstrous offspring of
  Persian dualism, favored the rise of every superstition.<a name="NtA8_26"
  href="#Nt8_26"><sup>[26]</sup></a></p>

  <p>However, the reign of the evil powers was not to last forever.
  According to common opinion the universe would be destroyed by fire<a
  name="NtA8_27" href="#Nt8_27"><sup>[27]</sup></a> after the times had
  been fulfilled. All the wicked would perish, but the just would be
  revived and establish the reign of universal happiness in the regenerated
  world.<a name="NtA8_28" href="#Nt8_28"><sup>[28]</sup></a></p>

  <p>The foregoing is a rapid sketch of the theology of paganism after
  three centuries of Oriental influence. From coarse fetichism and savage
  superstitions the learned priests of the Asiatic cults had gradually
  produced a complete system of metaphysics and eschatology, as the
  Brahmins built up the spiritualistic monism of the Vedanta beside the
  monstrous idolatry of Hinduism, or, to confine our comparisons to the
  Latin world, as the jurists drew from the traditional customs of
  primitive tribes the abstract principles of a legal system that governs
  the most cultivated societies. This religion was no longer like that of
  ancient Rome, a mere collection of propitiatory and expiatory rites
  performed by the citizen for the good of the state; it now pretended to
  offer to all men a world-conception which gave rise to a rule of conduct
  and placed the end of existence in the future life. It was more unlike
  the worship that Augustus had attempted to restore than the Christianity
  that fought it. The two opposed creeds moved in the same intellectual and
  moral sphere,<a name="NtA8_29" href="#Nt8_29"><sup>[29]</sup></a> and one
  could actually pass from one to the other without shock or interruption.
  Sometimes when <!-- Page 211 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page211"></a>[211]</span>reading the long works of the last Latin
  writers, like Ammianus Marcellinus or Boëthius, or the panegyrics of the
  official orators,<a name="NtA8_30" href="#Nt8_30"><sup>[30]</sup></a>
  scholars could well ask whether their authors were pagan or Christian. In
  the time of Symmachus and Praetextatus, the members of the Roman
  aristocracy who had remained faithful to the gods of their ancestors did
  not have a mentality or morality very different from that of adherents of
  the new faith who sat with them in the senate. The religious and mystical
  spirit of the Orient had slowly overcome the whole social organism and
  had prepared all nations to unite in the bosom of a universal church.</p>

<h3>NOTES.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">PREFACE.</p>

  <p><a name="NtP_1" href="#NtAP_1">1</a> We are indebted for more than one
  useful suggestion to our colleagues Messrs. Charles Michel and Joseph
  Bidez, who were kind enough to read the proofs of the French edition.</p>

  <p><a name="NtP_2" href="#NtAP_2">2</a> An outline of the present state
  of the subject will be found in a recent volume by Gruppe, <i>Griechische
  Mythologie</i>, 1906, pp. 1606 ff., whose views are sharply opposed to
  the negative conclusions formulated, with certain reservations, by
  Harnack, <i>Ausbreitung des Christentums</i>, II, pp. 274 ff. Among the
  latest studies intended for the general reader that have appeared on this
  subject, may be mentioned in Germany those of Geffcken (<i>Aus der
  Werdezeit des Christentums</i>, Leipsic, 1904, pp. 114 ff.), and in
  England those of Cheyne (<i>Bible Problems</i>, 1904), who expresses his
  opinion in these terms: "The Christian religion is a synthesis, and only
  those who have dim eyes can assert that the intellectual empires of
  Babylonia and Persia have fallen."&mdash;Very useful is the new book of
  Clemen, <i>Religionsgeschichtliche Erklärung des Neuen Testaments</i>,
  Giessen, 1909.</p>

  <p><a name="NtP_3" href="#NtAP_3">3</a> <i>Mon. myst. Mithra</i>, I, p.
  342, n. 4; see the new texts commented on by Usener, <i>Rhein.
  Museum</i>, LX, 1905, pp. 466 ff.; 489 ff., and my paper "Natalis
  Invicti," <i>C. R. Acad. des inscr.</i>, 1911.</p>

  <p><a name="NtP_4" href="#NtAP_4">4</a> See page 70. Compare also <i>Mon.
  myst. Mithra</i>, I, p. 341. The imitation of the church is plain in the
  pagan reform attempted by the emperor Julian.</p>

  <p><a name="NtP_5" href="#NtAP_5">5</a> See Harnack, <i>Militia
  Christi</i>, 1905.</p>

  <p><a name="NtP_6" href="#NtAP_6">6</a> I have collected a number of
  texts on the religious "militias" in <i>Mon. myst. Mithra</i>, I, p. 317,
  n. 1. Others could certainly be discovered: Apuleius, <i>Metam.</i>, XI,
  14: <i>E cohorte <!-- Page 214 --><span class="pagenum"><a

  Minucius Felix, 36, §&nbsp;7: <i>Quod patimur non est poena, militia
  est.</i>&mdash;We might also mention the commonplace term <i>militia
  Veneris</i>, which was popular with the Augustan poets (Propertius, IV,
  1, 137; see I, 6, 30; Horace, <i>Od.</i>, III, 26, and especially the
  parallel developed by Ovid, <i>Amor.</i>, I, 9, 1 ff., and <i>Ars
  amat.</i>, III, 233 ff.)&mdash;Socrates, in Plato's <i>Apologia</i> (p.
  28 E), incidentally likens the philosophic mission imposed on him by the
  divinity to the campaigns he waged under the orders of the archons, but
  the comparison of God with a "strategus" was developed especially by the
  Stoics; see Capelle, "Schrift von der Welt," <i>Neue Jahrb. für das
  klass. Altert.</i>, XV, 1905, p. 558, n. 6, and Seneca, <i>Epist.</i>,
  107, 9: <i>Optimum est Deum sine murmuratione comitari, malus miles est
  qui imperatorem gemens sequitur</i>.&mdash;See now also Reitzenstein,
  <i>Hellenistische Mysterienreligion</i>, 1910, p. 66.</p>

  <p><a name="NtP_7" href="#NtAP_7">7</a> See <i>Rev. des études
  grecques</i>, XIV, 1901, pp. 43 ff.</p>

  <p><a name="NtP_8" href="#NtAP_8">8</a> This has been clearly shown by
  Wendland in connection with the idea of the <span title="sôtêria" class="grk"
  >&sigma;&omega;&tau;&eta;&rho;&#x1F77;&alpha;</span>, <i>Zeitschrift für
  neutest. Wiss.</i>, V, 1904, pp. 355 ff. More recently he has thrown
  light on the general influence of Hellenistic civilization on
  Christianity (<i>Die hellenistisch-römische Kultur in ihren Beziehungen
  zum Judentum und Christentum</i>, Tübingen, 1908). A first attempt to
  determine the character of Hellenistic mysteries is to be found in
  Reitzenstein's <i>Hellenistische Mysterienreligion</i>, 1910.</p>

  I am defending here: "In ähnlicher Weise war dieser Gedanke (der

  der Erkenntniss, dass <!-- Page 215 --><span class="pagenum"><a

  <p><a name="Nt1_10" href="#NtA1_10">10</a>. This result is especially due
  to the researches of M. Strzygowski, but we cannot enter here into the
  controversies aroused by his publications: <i>Orient oder Rom</i>, 1911;
  <i>Hellas in des Orients Umarmung</i>, Munich, 1902, and especially
  <i>Kleinasien, ein Neuland der Kunstgeschichte</i>, Leipsic, 1903; [cf.
  the reports of Ch. Diehl, <i>Journal des Savants</i>, 1904, pp. 236 ff. =
  <i>Etudes byzantines</i>, 1905, pp. 336 ff.; Gabriel Millet, <i>Revue

  "Orient ou Byzance?" (<i>Rev. archéol.</i>, 1907, II, pp. 396 ff.), gives
  a substantial summary of the question.&mdash;In his last volume,
  <i>Amida</i> (1910), M. <!-- Page 216 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page216"></a>[216]</span>Strzygowski tries to find the source of
  medieval art in Mesopotamia. For this controversy see Diehl's <i>Manuel
  d'art byzantin</i>, 1910.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt1_11" href="#NtA1_11">11</a>. See also Pliny, <i>Epist.
  Traian.</i>, 40: "Architecti tibi [in Bithynia] deesse non possunt ...
  cum ex Graecia etiam ad nos [at Rome] venire soliti sint."&mdash;Among
  the names of architects mentioned in Latin inscriptions there are a great
  many revealing Greek or Oriental origin (see Ruggiero, <i>Dizion.
  epigr.</i>, s.&nbsp;v. "Architectus"), in spite of the consideration which
  their eminently useful profession always enjoyed at Rome.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt1_12" href="#NtA1_12">12</a>. The question of the artistic
  and industrial influences exercised by the Orient over Gaul during the
  Roman period, has been broached frequently&mdash;among others by Courajod
  (<i>Leçons du Louvre</i>, I, 1899, pp. 115, 327 ff.)&mdash;but it has
  never been seriously studied in its entirety. Michaëlis has recently
  devoted a suggestive article to this subject in connection with a statue
  from the museum of Metz executed in the style of the school of Pergamum
  (<i>Jahrb. der Gesellsch. für lothring. Geschichte</i>, XVII, 1905, pp.
  203 ff.). By the influence of Marseilles in Gaul, and the ancient
  connection of that city with the towns of Hellenic Asia, he explains the
  great difference between the works of sculpture discovered along the
  upper Rhine, which had been civilized by the Italian legions, and those
  unearthed on the other side of the Vosges. This is a very important
  discovery, rich in results. We believe, however, that Michaëlis ascribes
  too much importance to the early Marseilles traders traveling along the
  old "tin road" towards Brittany and the "amber road" towards Germany. The
  Asiatic merchants and artisans did not set out from one point only. There
  were many emigrants all over the valley of the Rhone. Lyons was a
  half-Hellenized city, and the relations of Arles with Syria, of Nîmes
  with Egypt, etc., are well known. We shall speak of them in connection
  with the religions of those countries.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt1_13" href="#NtA1_13">13</a>. Even in the bosom of the
  church the Latin Occident of the fourth century was still subordinate to
  the Greek Orient, which imposed its doctrinal problems upon it (Harnack,
  <i>Mission und Ausbreitung</i>, II, p. 283, n. 1).</p>

  <p><a name="Nt1_14" href="#NtA1_14">14</a>. The sacred formulas have been
  collected by Alb. Dieterich, <i>Eine Mithrasliturgie</i>, pp. 212 ff. He
  adds <span title="Doiê soi Osiris to psuchron hudôr" class="grk"

  <!-- Page 217 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page217"></a>[217]</span><i>Archiv für Religionswiss</i>., VII,
  1905, p. 504, n. 1. [Cf. <i>infra</i>, ch. IV, n. <a
  href="#Nt4_90">90</a>.] Among the hymns of greatest importance for the
  Oriental cults we must cite those in honor of Isis, discovered in the
  island of Andros (Kaibel, <i>Epigr.</i>, 4028) and elsewhere (see ch. IV,
  n. 6). Fragments of hymns in honor of Attis have been preserved by
  Hippolytus (<i>Philosoph.</i>, V, 9. pp. 168 ff.) The so-called orphic
  hymns (Abel, <i>Orphica</i>, 1883), which date back to a rather remote
  period, do not seem to contain many Oriental elements (see Maas,
  <i>Orpheus</i>, 1893, pp. 173 ff.), but this does not apply to the
  gnostic hymns of which we possess very instructive fragments.&mdash;Cf.
  <i>Mon. myst. de Mithra</i>, I, p. 313, n. 1.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt1_15" href="#NtA1_15">15</a>. Regarding the imitations of
  the stage, see Adami, <i>De poetis scen. Graecis hymnorum sacrorum
  imitatoribus</i>, 1901. Wünsch has shown the liturgic character of a
  prayer to Asklepios, inserted by Herondas into his mimiambi (<i>Archiv
  für Religionswiss.</i>, VII, 1904, pp. 95 ff.) Dieterich believes he has
  found an extensive extract from the Mithraic liturgy in a magic papyrus
  of Paris (see <i>infra</i>, ch. VI, <a href="#Nt6Bib">Bibliography</a>).
  But all these discoveries amount to very little if we think of the
  enormous number of liturgic texts that have been lost, and even in the
  case of ancient Greece we know little regarding this sacred literature.
  See Ausfeld, <i>De Graecorum precationibus</i>, Leipsic, 1903; Ziegler,
  <i>De precationum apud Graecos formis quaestiones selectae</i>, Breslau,
  1905; H. Schmidt, <i>Veteres philosophi quomodo iudicaverint de
  precibus</i>, Giessen, 1907.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt1_16" href="#NtA1_16">16</a>. For instance, the hymn "which
  the magi sung" about the steeds of the supreme god; its contents are
  given by Dion Chrysostom, Oral., XXXVI, 39 (see <i>Mon. myst. Mithra</i>,
  I. p. 298; II, p. 60).</p>

  <p><a name="Nt1_17" href="#NtA1_17">17</a>. I have in mind the hymns of
  Cleanthes (Von Arnim, <i>Stoic. fragm.</i>, I, Nos. 527, 537), also
  Demetrius's act of renunciation in Seneca, <i>De Provid.</i>, V, 5, which
  bears a surprising resemblance to one of the most famous Christian
  prayers, the <i>Suscipe</i> of Saint Ignatius which concludes the book of
  Spiritual Exercises (Delehaye, <i>Les légendes hagiographiques</i>, 1905,
  p. 170, n. 1).&mdash;In this connection we ought to mention the prayer
  translated in the <i>Asclepius</i>, the Greek text <!-- Page 218 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page218"></a>[218]</span>of which has recently
  been found on a papyrus (Reitzenstein, <i>Archiv für Religionswiss.</i>,
  VII, 1904, p. 395). On pagan prayers introduced into the Christian
  liturgy see Reitzenstein and Wendland, <i>Nachrichten Ges. Wiss.</i>,
  Göttingen, 1910, pp. 325 ff.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt1_18" href="#NtA1_18">18</a>. This point has been studied
  more in detail in our <i>Monuments relatifs aux mystères de Mithra</i>,
  from which we have taken parts of the following observations (I, pp. 21
  ff.).</p>

  <p><a name="Nt1_19" href="#NtA1_19">19</a>. Lucian's authorship of the
  treatise <span title="Peri tês Suriês theou" class="grk"

  &Sigma;&upsilon;&rho;&#x1F77;&eta;&sigmaf;
  &theta;&epsilon;&omicron;&#x1FE6;</span> has been questioned but wrongly;
  see Maurice Croiset, <i>Essai sur Lucien</i>, 1882, pp. 63, 204. I am
  glad to be able to cite the high authority of Nöldeke in favor of its
  authenticity. Nöldeke writes me on this subject: "Ich habe jeden Zweifel
  daran schon lange aufgegeben.... Ich habe lange den Plan gehabt, einen
  Commentar zu diesem immerhin recht lehrreichen Stück zu schreiben and
  viel Material dazu gesammelt. Aus der Annahme der Echtheit dieser Schrift

  that interests us. On the period following we have nothing but a
  provisional sketch by the same author, <i>Romanismus und Hellenismus bis

  of races has been set forth in particular by Stewart Chamberlain, <i>Die

  <p><a name="Nt2_9" href="#NtA2_9">9</a>. The intimate connection between
  the juridical and religious ideas of the Romans has left numerous traces
  even in their language. One of the most curious is the double meaning of
  the term <i>supplicium</i>, which stands at the same time for a
  supplication addressed to the gods and a punishment <!-- Page 220
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page220"></a>[220]</span>demanded by
  custom, and later by law. In regard to the development of this twofold
  meaning, see the recent note by Richard Heinze, <i>Archiv für lateinische
  Lexicographie</i>, XV, pp. 90 ff. Sematology is often synonymous with the
  study of customs.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt2_23" href="#NtA2_23">23</a> In Greece the Oriental cults
  expanded much less than in any other religion, because the Hellenic
  mysteries, especially those of Eleusis, taught similar doctrines and
  satisfied the religious needs.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt2_24" href="#NtA2_24">24</a> The development of the "ritual
  of purification" has been broadly expounded in its entirety, by Farnell
  in <i>The Evolution of Religion</i>, 1905, pp. 88 ff.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt2_26" href="#NtA2_26">26</a> We cannot dwell here upon the
  various forms assumed by that purifying rite of the Oriental mysteries.
  Often these forms remained quite primitive, and the idea that inspired
  them is still clear, as where Juvenal (VI, 521 f.) pictures the <!-- Page
  222 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page222"></a>[222]</span>worshiper
  of the <i>Magna Mater</i> divesting himself of his beautiful garments and
  giving them to the <i>archigallus</i> to wipe out all the misdeeds of the
  year (<i>ut totum semel expiet annum</i>). The idea of a mechanical
  transfer of the pollution by relinquishing the clothes is frequent among
  savages; see Farnell, <i>op. cit.</i>, p. 117; also Frazer, <i>Golden

  <p><a name="Nt2_29" href="#NtA2_29">29</a> Here we can only touch upon a

  <p><a name="Nt2_34" href="#NtA2_34">34</a> We know according to Herbert

  and lay functions is one of the characteristics of religious evolution.
  In this regard Rome was far behind the Orient.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt2_35" href="#NtA2_35">35</a> An essential result of the
  researches of Otto (<i>op. cit.</i>) is the proof of the opposition
  existing in Egypt since the Ptolemies between the hierarchic organization
  of the Egyptian clergy and the almost anarchical autonomy of the Greek
  priests. See our remarks on the clergy of Isis and the Galli. On the
  Mithraic hierarchy see our <i>Mysteries of Mithra</i>, Chicago, 1903, p.
  165.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt2_36" href="#NtA2_36">36</a> The development of the

  <p><a name="Nt2_37" href="#NtA2_37">37</a> Later on we shall expound the
  two principal doctrines, that of the Egyptian religions (identification
  with Osiris, god of the dead), and that of the Syrian and Persian
  religions (ascension into heaven).</p>

  <p><a name="Nt2_38" href="#NtA2_38">38</a> At that time man's fate after
  death was the one great interest. An interesting example of the power of
  this idea is furnished by Arnobius. He became converted to Christianity
  because, according to his peculiar psychology, he feared that his soul
  might die, and believed that Christ alone could protect him against final
  annihilation (cf. Bardenhewer, <i>Gesch. der altkirchlichen
  Literatur</i>, II, 1903, p. 470.)</p>

  <p><a name="Nt2_39" href="#NtA2_39">39</a> Lucretius had expressed this

  remote period as devouring a bull or other animals, might possibly
  represent the sacred animal of Lydia or Phrygia vanquishing the
  protecting <i>totem</i> of the tribes of Cappadocia or the neighboring
  countries (I am using the term <i>totem</i> in its broadest meaning).
  This at least is the interpretation given to similar groups in Egypt. Cf.

  X, 1908, p. 157. The pagan theologians often considered Attis as the

  celebration of Attis's death on the same date, just as Christmas has been
  substituted for the <i>Natalis Invicti</i>. The text of Ambrosiaster

  Ruhl (op. cit., p. 4) attaches no historic value to this text, but, as he
  points out himself, we have proof that an official Isis cult existed at
  Athens under Ptolemy Soter, and that Serapis was worshiped in that city
  at the beginning of the third century.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt4_18" href="#NtA4_18">18</a>. Thus it is found to be the
  case from the first half of the third century at Thera, a naval station
  of the Ptolemies (Hiller von Gärtringen, <i>Thera</i>, III, pp. 85 ff.;
  cf. Ruhl, <i>op. cit.</i>, p. 59), and also at Rhodes (<i>Rev.
  archéol.</i>, 1905, I, p. 341). Cult of Serapis at Delos, cf. <i>Comptes
  rendus Acad. inscr.</i>, 1910, pp. 294 ff.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt4_19" href="#NtA4_19">19</a>. A number of proofs of its
  diffusion have been collected by Drexler, <i>loc. cit.</i>, p. 379. See
  Lafaye, "Isis" (cf. <i>supra</i>), p. 577; and Ruhl, <i>De Sarapide et
  Iside in Graecia cultis</i>, 1906.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt4_20" href="#NtA4_20">20</a>. This interpretation has
  already been proposed by Ravaisson (<i>Gazette archéologique</i>, I, pp.
  55 ff.), and I believe it to be correct, see <i>Comptes Rendus Acad.
  Inscr.</i>, 1906, p. 75, n. 1.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt4_21" href="#NtA4_21">21</a>. The power of the Egyptian
  cult in the Oriental half of the empire has been clearly shown by von
  Domaszewski (<i>Röm. Mitt.</i>, XVII, 1902, pp. 333 ff.), but perhaps
  with some exaggeration. All will endorse the restrictions formulated by
  Harnack, <i>Ausbreitung des Christentums</i>, II, p. 274.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt4_22" href="#NtA4_22">22</a>. The very early spread of
  Orphic doctrines in Magna Graecia, evidenced by the tablets of Sybaris
  and Petilia (Diels, <!-- Page 232 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page232"></a>[232]</span><i>Vorsokratiker</i>, II<sup>2</sup>, p.
  480) must have prepared the way for it. These tablets possess many points
  in common with the eschatological beliefs of Egypt, but, as their latest
  commentator justly remarks (Harrison, <i>Prolegomena to the Study of
  Greek Religion</i>, p. 624), these new ideas are fairly overwhelmed in
  the old mythology. The mysteries of Isis and Serapis seemed to offer a
  revelation that had been a presentiment for a long time, and the
  affirmation of a truth foreshadowed by early symbols.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt4_41" href="#NtA4_41">41</a>. I did not mention Hermetism,
  made prominent by the researches of Reitzenstein, because I believe its
  influence in the Occident to have been purely literary. To my knowledge
  there is no trace in the Latin world of an Hermetic sect with a clergy
  and following. The <i>Heliognostae</i> or <i>Deinvictiaci</i> who, in
  Gaul, attempted to assimilate the native Mercury with the Egyptian Thoth,
  (<i>Mon. myst. Mithra</i>, I, p. 49, n. 2; cf. 359), were Christian
  gnostics. I believe that Reitzenstein misunderstood the facts when he
  stated (<i>Wundererzählungen</i>, 1906, p. 128): "Die hermetische
  Literatur ist im zweiten und dritten Jahrhundert für alle
  religiös-interessierten der allgemeine Ausdruck der Frömmigkeit
  geworden." I believe that <!-- Page 234 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page234"></a>[234]</span>Hermetism, which is used as a label for
  doctrines of very different origin, was influenced by "the universal
  spirit of devotion," and was not its creator. It was the result of a long
  continued effort to reconcile the Egyptian traditions first with Chaldean
  astrology, then with Greek philosophy, and it became transformed
  simultaneously with the philosophy. But this subject would demand
  extended development. It is admitted by Otto, the second volume of whose
  book has been published since the writing of these lines, that not even
  during the Hellenistic period was there enough theological activity of
  the Egyptian clergy to influence the religion of the times. (<i>Priester
  und Tempel</i>, II, pp. 218-220).</p>

  Dennison to give his attention to the tonsure of the votaries of Isis
  (<i>American Journ. of Archeology</i>, V, 1905, p. 341). The Pompeian
  frescoes representing priests and ceremonies of the Isis cult are
  particularly important for our knowledge of the liturgy (Guimet, <i>C. R.

  consecration brought the statue to life (<i>supra</i>, n. <a
  href="#Nt4_55">55</a>), the repeated sacrifices sustained life, and made
  it <i>longa durare per tempora</i> (Ps.-Apul., <i>Asclep.</i>, 38). The

  several divinities (<i>CIG</i>, 4598; <i>Griech. Urkunden</i> of Berlin,

  god Thoth set out in a boat to seek the body of Osiris. Elsewhere it was
  Isis who sailed out in quest of it. We do not know whether this scene was
  played at Rome; but it certainly was played at Gallipoli where
  make-believe fishermen handled the nets in a make-believe Nile; cf. P.

  <p><a name="Nt4_89" href="#NtA4_89">89</a>. We find similar wishes on the
  Egyptian monuments, frequently at least since the Middle Empire.
  "Donnez-moi de l'eau courante à boire.... Mettez-moi la face au vent du
  nord sur le bord de l'eau et que sa fraîcheur calme mon c&oelig;ur"
  (Maspero, <i>Etudes égyptiennes</i>, I, 1881, p. 189). "Oh, si j'avais de
  l'eau courante à boire et si mon visage était tourné vers le vent du
  nord" (Naville,<i>op. cit.</i>, p. 174). On a funerary stele in the
  Brussels museum (Capart, <i>Guide</i>, 1905, p. 71) is inscribed, "Que
  les dieux accordent de boire l'eau des sources, de respirer les doux
  vents du nord."&mdash;The very material origin of this wish appears in
  the funeral texts, where the soul is shown crossing the desert,
  threatened with hunger and thirst, and obtaining refreshment by the aid
  of the gods (Maspero, <i>Etudes de mythol. et d'archéol. égypt.</i>,
  1883, I, pp. <!-- Page 239 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page239"></a>[239]</span>366 ff.).&mdash;On a tablet at Petilia
  (see <i>supra</i>, n. <a href="#Nt4_22">22</a>), the soul of the deceased
  is required to drink the fresh water (<span title="psuchron hudôr" class="grk"
  >&psi;&upsilon;&chi;&rho;&#x1F78;&nu; &#x1F55;&delta;&omega;&rho;</span>)
  flowing from the lake of Memory in order to reign with the heroes. There
  is nothing to prevent our admitting with Foucart ("Myst. d'Eleusis,"
  <i>Mém. Acad. des Inscr.</i>, XXXV, 2, p. 67), that the Egyptian ideas
  may have permeated the Orphic worship of southern Italy after the fourth
  or third century, since they are found expressed a hundred years earlier
  at Carpentras (<i>infra</i>, n. <a href="#Nt4_90">90</a>).</p>

  6267 = Kaibel, 1890. It is particularly interesting to note that almost
  the same wish appears on the Aramaic stele of Carpentras (<i>C. I.
  Sem.</i>, II, 141), which dates back to the fourth or fifth century
  B.&nbsp;C.: "Blessed be thou, take water from in front of Osiris."&mdash;A
  passage in the book of Enoch manifestly inspired by Egyptian conceptions,
  mentions the "spring of water," the "spring of life," in the realm of the
  dead (Enoch, xxii. 2, 9. Cf. Martin, <i>Le livre d'Hénoch</i>, 1906, p.
  58, n. 1, and Bousset, <i>Relig. des Judentums</i>, 1903, p 271). From
  Judaism the expression has passed into Christianity. Cf. Rev. vii. 17;
  xxi. 6.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt4_91" href="#NtA4_91">91</a>. The Egyptian origin of the
  Christian expression has frequently been pointed out and cannot be
  doubted; see Lafaye, <i>op. cit.</i>, p. 96, n. 1; Rohde, <i>Psyche</i>,
  II, p. 391; Kraus, <i>Realencycl. der christl. Alt.</i>, s.&nbsp;v.
  "Refrigerium"; and especially Dieterich, <i>Nekyia</i>, pp. 95 ff. Cf.
  Perdrizet, <i>Rev. des études anc.</i>, 1905, p. 32; Audollent,
  <i>Mélanges Louis Havet</i>, 1909, p. 575.&mdash;The <i>refrigerii
  sedes</i>, which the Catholic Church petitions for the deceased in the
  anniversary masses, appears in the oldest Latin liturgies, and the
  Greeks, who do not believe in purgatory, have always expressed themselves
  along the same lines. For instance, Nubian inscriptions which are in
  perfect agreement with the euchology of Constantinople hope the soul will
  rest <span title="en topôi chloerôi, en topôi anapsuxeôs" class="grk"
  >&#x1F10;&nu; &tau;&#x1F79;&pi;&#x1FF3;

  &tau;&#x1F79;&pi;&#x1FF3;
  &#x1F00;&nu;&alpha;&psi;&#x1F7B;&xi;&epsilon;&omega;&sigmaf;</span> (G.
  Lefebvre, <i>Inscr. gr. chrét. d'Eg.</i>, No. 636, 664 ff., and introd.,
  p. xxx; cf. Dumont, <i>Mélanges</i>, Homolle ed., pp. 585 ff.). The
  detail is not without significance because it furnishes a <!-- Page 240
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page240"></a>[240]</span>valuable
  indication as to the Egyptian origin of prayer for the dead; this is
  unknown to Graeco-Roman paganism which prayed to the deified dead but
  never <i>for</i> the dead as such. The Church took this custom from the
  Synagogue, but the Jews themselves seem to have taken it from the
  Egyptians during the Hellenistic period, undoubtedly in the course of the
  second century (S. Reinach, <i>Cultes, mythes</i>, I, p. 325), just as
  they were indebted to the Egyptians for the idea of the "spring of life"
  (<i>supra</i>, n. <a href="#Nt4_90">90</a>). The formula in the Christian
  inscriptions cited,</p>

  <p><span title="anapauson tên psuchên en kolpois Abraam kai Isaak kai Iakôb" class="grk"
  >&#x1F00;&nu;&#x1F71;&pi;&alpha;&upsilon;&sigma;&omicron;&nu;

  &#x1F38;&alpha;&kappa;&#x1F7D;&beta;</span>,</p>

  <p>appears to indicate a transposition of the doctrine of identification
  with Osiris. In this way we can explain the persistence in the Christian
  formulary of expressions, like <i>requies aeterna</i>, corresponding to
  the most primitive pagan conceptions of the life of the dead, who were
  not to be disturbed in their graves.&mdash;A name for the grave, which
  appears frequently in Latin epitaphs, viz., <i>domus aeterna</i> (or
  <i>aeternalis</i>) is undoubtedly also of Egyptian importation. In Egypt,
  "la tombe est la maison du mort, sa maison d'étérnite, comme disent les
  textes" (Capart, <i>Guide du musée de Bruxelles</i>, 1905, p. 32). The
  Greeks were struck by this expression which appears in innumerable
  instances. Diodorus of Sicily (I, 51, §&nbsp;2) was aware that the
  Egyptians</p>

  <p>It is probable that this appellation of the tomb passed from Egypt
  into Palestine and Syria. It appears already in Ecclesiastes, xii. 7
  (<i>beth &rsquo;olam</i> = "house of eternity"), and it is found in
  Syrian epigraphy (for instance in inscriptions of the third century
  (<i>Comptes Rendus Acad. Inscr.</i>, 1906, p. 123), also in the epigraphy
  of Palmyra. (Chabot, <i>Journal asiatique</i>, 1900, p. 266, No.
  47)).&mdash;Possibly the hope for consolation, <span title="Eupsuchei, oudeis athanatos" class="grk"

  the epitaphs of initiates in the Alexandrian mysteries. Kaibel, <i>Inscr.

  2098 (cf. <i>supra</i>, n. <a href="#Nt4_90">90</a>). Possibly the
  twofold meaning of <!-- Page 241 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page241"></a>[241]</span><span title="eupsuchos" class="grk"
  >&epsilon;&#x1F54;&psi;&upsilon;&chi;&omicron;&sigmaf;</span> which
  stands both for <i>animosus</i> and <i>frigidus</i> (see Dieterich,
  <i>Nekyia</i>, <i>loc. cit.</i>) has been played upon. But on the other
  hand, the idea contained in the formula "Be cheerful, nobody is
  immortal," also inspired the "Song of the Harpist," a canonical hymn that
  was sung in Egypt on the day of the funeral. It invited the listener to
  "make his heart glad" before the sadness of inevitable death (Maspero,
  <i>Etudes égyptiennes</i>, I, 1881, pp. 171 ff.; cf. Naville, <i>op.
  cit.</i>, p. 171).</p>

  <p><a name="Nt5_36" href="#NtA5_36">36</a>. The ancient authors
  frequently alluded to this superstition of the Syrians (the texts have
  been collected by Selden, <i>De dis Syris</i>, II, C. 3, pp. 268 ff., ed.
  of 1672). W. Robertson Smith (<i>loc. cit.</i>, p. 449), is right in
  connecting it with certain ideas of savages. Like many primitive beliefs,
  this one has continued to the present day. It has been pointed out to me
  that at Sam-Keuï, a little west of Doliché, there is a pond fed by a
  spring and well stocked with fish, which one is forbidden to take. Near
  the mosque of Edessa is a large pond where catching fish is prohibited.
  They are considered sacred, and the people believe that any one who would
  eat them would die instantly. (Sachau, <i>Reise in Syrien</i>, 1883, pp.
  196 ff. Cf. Lord Warkworth, <i>Diary in Asiatic Turkey</i>, London, 1898,
  p. 242). The same is the case at the mosque of Tripoli and elsewhere
  (Lammens, <i>Au pays des Nosaïris</i> [<i>Revue de l'Orient
  chrétien</i>], 1908, p. 2). Even in Asia Minor this superstition is
  found. At Tavshanli, north of Aezani on the upper Rhyndacus, there is
  to-day a square cistern filled with sacred fish which no one is allowed
  to take (on the authority of Munro). Travelers in Turkey have frequently
  observed that the people do not eat fish, even when there is a scarcity
  of food (Sachau, <i>loc. cit.</i>, p. 196) and the general belief that
  their flesh is unhealthful and can cause sickness is not entirely
  unfounded. Here is what Ramsay has to say on the subject (<i>Impressions
  of Turkey</i>, London, 1897, p. 288): "Fish are rarely found and when
  found are usually bad: the natives have a prejudice against fish, and my
  own experience has been unfavorable.... In the clear sparkling mountain
  stream that flows through the Taurus by Bozanti-Khan, a small kind of
  fish is caught; I had a most violent attack of sickness in 1891 after
  eating some of them, and so had all who partook." Captain Wilson, who
  spent a number of years in <!-- Page 246 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page246"></a>[246]</span>Asia Minor, asserts (<i>Handbook of
  Asia-Minor</i>, p. 19), that "the natives do not eat fish to any extent."
  The "totemic" prohibition in this instance really seems to have a
  hygienic origin. People abstained from all kinds of fish because some
  species were dangerous, that is to say, inhabited by evil spirits, and
  the tumors sent by the Syrian goddess were merely the edemas caused by
  the poisoning.</p>

  There were also sacred repasts in the Occident in the various Syrian

  <p><a name="Nt5_41" href="#NtA5_41">41</a>. Much has been written about
  the sacred prostitutions in paganism, and it is well known that Voltaire
  ridiculed the scholars who were credulous enough to believe in the tales
  of Herodotus. But this practice has been proven by <!-- Page 247 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page247"></a>[247]</span>irrefutable testimony.
  Strabo, for instance, whose great-uncle was arch-priest of Comana,
  mentions it in connection with that city, (XII, 3, 36, p. 559 C), and he
  manifests no surprise. The history of religion teaches many stranger
  facts; this one, however, is disconcerting. The attempt has been made to
  see in it a relic of the primitive promiscuity or polyandry, or a
  persistence of "sexual hospitality," ("No custom is more widely spread
  than the providing for a guest a female companion, who is usually a wife
  or daughter of the host," says Wake, <i>Serpent Worship</i>, 1888, p.
  158); or the substitution of union with a man for union with the god
  (Gruppe, <i>Griech. Mythol.</i>, p. 915). But these hypotheses do not
  explain the peculiarities of the religious custom as it is described by
  more reliable authors. They insist upon the fact that the girls were
  dedicated to the temple service while <i>virgins</i>, and that after
  having had <i>strangers</i> for lovers, they married in their own
  country. Thus Strabo (XI, 14, §&nbsp;16, p. 532 C.) narrates in connection
  with the temple of Anaitïs in Acilisena, that <span title="thugateras hoi epiphanestatoi tou ethnous anierousi parthenous, ais nomos esti kataporneutheisais polun chronon para têi theôi meta tauta didosthai pros gamon, ouk apaxiountos têi toiautêi sunoikein oudenos" class="grk"

  &omicron;&#x1F50;&delta;&epsilon;&nu;&#x1F79;&sigmaf;</span>. Herodotus
  (I, 93), who relates about the same thing of the Lydian women, adds that
  they acquired a dowry in that manner; an inscription at Tralles (<i>Bull.
  corr. hell.</i>, VII, 1885, p. 276) actually mentions a descendant of a
  sacred prostitute (<span title="ek progonôn pallakidôn" class="grk"
  >&#x1F10;&kappa; &pi;&rho;&omicron;&gamma;&#x1F79;&nu;&omega;&nu;
  &pi;&alpha;&lambda;&lambda;&alpha;&kappa;&#x1F77;&delta;&omega;&nu;</span>)
  who had temporarily filled the same office (<span title="pallakeusasa kata chrêsmon Dii" class="grk"

  &kappa;&alpha;&tau;&#x1F70; &chi;&rho;&eta;&sigma;&mu;&#x1F78;&nu;
  &Delta;&iota;&#x1F77;</span>). Even at Thebes in Egypt there existed a
  similar custom with striking local peculiarities in the time of Strabo
  (XVII, 1, §&nbsp;46), and traces of it seem to have been found in Greece among
  the Locrians (Vurtheim, <i>De Aiacis origine</i>, Leyden, 1907). Every
  Algerian traveler knows how the girls of the Ouled-Naïl earn their dowry
  in the <i>ksours</i> and the cities, before they go back to their tribes
  to marry, and Doutté (<i>Notes sur l'Islam maghrébien, les Marabouts</i>,
  Extr. <i>Rev. hist. des relig.</i>, XL-XLI, Paris, 1900), has connected
  these usages with the old Semitic prostitution, but his thesis has been
  attacked and the historical circumstances of the arrival of the
  Ouled-Naïl in Algeria in the eleventh century render it very doubtful
  (Note by Basset).&mdash;It seems certain (I do not know whether this
  explanation has ever been offered) <!-- Page 248 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page248"></a>[248]</span>that this strange
  practice is a modified utilitarian form of an ancient exogamy. Besides it
  had certain favorable results, since it protected the girl against the
  brutality of her kindred until she was of marriageable age, and this fact
  must have insured its persistence; but the idea that inspired it at first
  was different. "La première union sexuelle impliquant une effusion de
  sang, a été interdite, lorsque ce sang était celui d'une fille du clan
  versé par le fait d'un homme du clan" (Salomon Reinach, <i>Mythes,
  cultes</i>, I, 1905, p. 79. Cf. Lang, <i>The Secret of the Totem</i>,
  London, 1905.) Thence rose the obligation on virgins to yield to a
  stranger first. Only then were they permitted to marry a man of their own
  race. Furthermore, various means were resorted to in order to save the
  husband from the defilement which might result from that act (see for
  inst., Reinach, <i>Mythes, cultes</i>, I, p. 118).&mdash;The opinion
  expressed in this note was attacked, almost immediately after its
  publication, by Frazer (<i>Adonis, Attis, Osiris</i>, 1907, pp. 50 ff.)
  who preferred to see in the sacred prostitutions a relic of primitive
  communism. But at least one of the arguments which he uses against our
  views is incorrect. Not the women, but the men, received presents in
  Acilisena (Strabo, <i>loc. cit.</i>) and the communistic theory does not
  seem to account for the details of the custom prevailing in the temple of
  Thebes. There the horror of blood clearly appears. On the discovery of a
  skull (having served at a rite of consecration) in the temple of the
  Janiculum, see the article cited above, "Dea Syria," in <i>Dict. des

  further than the time of the Ptolemies.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt5_57" href="#NtA5_57">57</a>. The Seleucides, like the
  Roman emperors later, believed in Chaldean astrology (Appian.,
  <i>Syr.</i>, 28; Diodorus, II, 31, 2; cf. Riess in Pauly-Wissowa,
  <i>Realenc.</i>, s.&nbsp;v. "Astrologie," col. 1814), and the kings of
  Commagene, as well as of a great number of Syrian cities, had the signs
  of the zodiac as emblems on their coins. It is even certain that this
  pseudo-science penetrated into those regions long before the Hellenistic
  period. Traces of it are found in the Old Testament (Schiaparelli;
  translation by Lüdke, <i>Die Astron. im Alten Testament</i>, 1904, p.
  46). It modified the entire Semitic paganism. The only cult which we know
  in any detail, that of the Sabians, assigned the highest importance to
  it; but in the myths and doctrines of the others its influence is no less
  apparent (Pauly-Wissowa, <i>Realencycl.</i>, s.&nbsp;v. "Dea Syria," IV, col.
  2241, and s.&nbsp;v. "Gad"; cf. Baudissin, <i>Realencycl. für prot.
  Theol.</i>, s.&nbsp;v., "Sonne," pp. 510-520). To what extent, for instance,
  the clergy of Emesa had been subjected to its ascendency is shown by the
  novel of Heliodorus, written by a priest of that city (Rohde, <i>Griech.
  Roman</i><sup>2</sup>, p. 464 [436]), and by the horoscope that put Julia
  Domna upon the throne (<i>Vita Severi</i>, 3, 8; cf. A. von Domaszewski,
  <i>Archiv für Religionsw.</i>, XI, 1908, p. 223). The irresistible
  influence extended even to the Arabian paganism (Nöldeke in Hastings,
  <i>Encyclop. of Religion</i>, s.&nbsp;v. "Arabs," I, p. 661; compare, <i>Orac.
  Sibyll.</i>, XIII, 64 ff., on Bostra). The sidereal character which has
  been attributed to the Syrian gods, was borrowed, but none the less real.
  From very early times the Semites worshiped the sun, <!-- Page 252
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page252"></a>[252]</span>the moon, and
  the stars (see Deut. iv. 19; Job xxxi. 25), especially the planet Venus,
  but this cult was of secondary importance only (see W. Robertson Smith,
  <i>op. cit.</i>, p. 135, n. 1), although it grew in proportion as the
  Babylonian influence became stronger. The polemics of the Fathers of the
  Syrian Church show how considerable its prestige was in the Christian era
  (cf. Ephrem, <i>Opera Syriaca</i>, Rome, 1740, II, pp. 447 ff.; the
  "Assyrian" Tatian, c. 9 ff., etc.).</p>

  from the Tigris to the Nile, must have had as a corollary the
  establishment of an official worship that was necessarily syncretic.
  Hence its special importance for the history of paganism. Although the
  Babylonian astrology was a powerful factor in this worship, Judaism seems
  to have had just as great an influence in its formation. There was at
  Palmyra a large Jewish colony, which the writers of the Talmud considered
  only tolerably orthodox (Chaps, <i>Gli Ebrei di Palmira</i> [<i>Rivista
  Israelitica</i>, I], Florence, 1904, pp. 171 ff., 238 f. Cf. "Palmyra" in
  the <i>Jewish Encycl.</i>; Jewish insc. of Palmyra; Euting, <i>Sitzb.
  Berl. Acad.</i>, 1885, p. 669; Landauer, <i>ibid.</i>, 1884, pp. 933
  ff.). This colony seems to have made compromises with the idolaters. On
  the other hand we see Zenobia herself rebuilding a synagogue in Egypt
  (<i>Revue archéologique</i>, XXX, 1875, p. III; <i>Zeitschrift für
  Numismatik</i>, V, p. 229; Dittenberger, <i>Orientis inscript.</i>, 729).
  This influence of Judaism seems to explain the development at Palmyra of
  the cult of <span title="Zeus hupsitos kai epêkoos" class="grk"
  >&Zeta;&epsilon;&#x1F7A;&sigmaf;
  &#x1F55;&psi;&iota;&tau;&omicron;&sigmaf; &kappa;&alpha;&#x1F76;
  &#x1F10;&pi;&#x1F75;&kappa;&omicron;&omicron;&sigmaf;</span>, "he whose
  name is blessed in eternity." The name of Hypsistos has been applied
  everywhere to Jehovah and to the pagan Zeus (<i>supra</i>, p. <a
  href="#page62">62</a>, <a href="#page128">128</a>) at the same time. The
  text of Zosimus (I, 61), according to which Aurelian brought from Palmyra
  to Rome the statues of <span title="Hêliou te kai Bêlou" class="grk"

  >&tau;&omicron;&#x1FE6; &kappa;&alpha;&#x1F76;
  &Beta;&#x1F75;&lambda;&omicron;&upsilon;</span>), proves that the <!--
  Page 253 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page253"></a>[253]</span>astrological religion of the great desert
  city recognized a supreme god residing in the highest heavens, and a
  solar god, his visible image and agent, according to the Semitic theology
  of the last period of paganism (<i>supra</i>, p. <a
  href="#page134">134</a>).</p>

  <p><a name="Nt5_60" href="#NtA5_60">60</a>. I have spoken of this solar

  <p><a name="Nt5_61" href="#NtA5_61">61</a>. This opinion is that of
  Posidonius (see Wendland, <i>Philos Schrift über die Vorsehung</i>,
  Berlin, 1892, p. 68, n. 1; 70, n. 2). It is shared by the ancient
  astrologers.</p>

  are guided to heaven by a psychopompus, is found not only in the
  mysteries of Mithra (<i>Mon. myst. Mithra</i>, I, p. 310), but also in
  the Syrian cults where that rôle was often assigned to the solar god, see
  Isid. Lévy, <i>Cultes syriens dans le Talmud</i> (<i>Revue des études
  juives</i>, XLIII), 1901, p. 5, and Dussaud, <i>Notes</i>, p. 27; cf. the

  <p><a name="Nt5_64" href="#NtA5_64">64</a>. The Babylonian origin of the
  doctrine that the souls returned to heaven by crossing the seven
  planetary spheres, has been maintained by Anz (<i>Zur Frage nach dem
  Ursprung des Gnostizismus</i>, 1897; cf. <i>Mon. myst. Mithra</i>, I. pp.
  38 ff., p. 309; Bousset, <i>Die Himmelsreise der Seele</i> [<i>Archiv für
  Religionsw.</i>, IV], 1901, pp. 160 ff.) and "Gnosis" in Pauly-Wissowa,
  <i>Realencyclopädie</i>, col. 1520. It has since been denied by
  Reitzenstein (<i>Poimandres</i>, p. 79; cf. Kroll, <i>Berl. philol.
  Wochensch.</i>, <!-- Page 254 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page254"></a>[254]</span>1906, p. 486). But although it may have
  been given its precise shape and been transformed by the Greeks and even
  by the Egyptians, I persist in believing that it is of Chaldean and
  religious origin. I heartily agree with the conclusions recently
  formulated by Bousset, (<i>Göttingische gelehrte Anzeigen</i>, 1905, pp.
  707 ff.). We can go farther: Whatever roots it may have had in the
  speculations of ancient Greece (Aristoph., <i>Pax</i>, 832, Plato,
  <i>Tim.</i>, 42B, cf. Haussoullier, <i>Rev. de philol.</i>, 1909, pp. 1
  ff.), whatever traces of it may be found in other nations (Dieterich,
  <i>Mithrasliturgie</i>, pp. 182 ff.; <i>Nekyia</i>, p. 24, note; Rohde,
  <i>Psyche</i>, II, p. 131, n. 3), the idea itself of the soul rising to
  the divine stars after death certainly developed under the influence of
  the sidereal worship of the Semites to a point where it dominated all
  other eschatological theories. The belief in the eternity of souls is the
  corollary to the belief in the eternity of the celestial gods (p. 129).
  We cannot give the history of this conception here, and we shall limit
  ourselves to brief observations. The first account of this system ever
  given at Rome is found in "Scipio's Dream" (c. 3); it probably dates back
  to Posidonius of Apamea (cf. Wendland, <i>Die hellenistisch-römische
  Kultur</i>, p. 85, 166, n. 3, 168, n. 1), and is completely impregnated
  with mysticism and astrolatry. The same idea is found a little later in
  the astrologer Manilius (I, 758; IV, 404, etc.). The shape which it
  assumed in Josephus (<i>Bell. Judaic.</i>, V, 1, 5, §&nbsp;47) is also much
  more religious than philosophical and is strikingly similar to a dogma of
  Islam (happiness in store for those dying in battle; a Syrian
  [<i>ibid.</i>, §&nbsp;54] risks his life that his soul may go to heaven). This
  recalls the inscription of Antiochus of Commagene (Michel,
  <i>Recueil</i>, No. 735, l. 40):</p>

  <p>It must be said that this sidereal immortality was not originally
  common to all men; it was reserved "omnibus qui patriam conservaverint
  adiuverint, auxerint" (<i>Somn. Scip.</i> c. 3, c. 8; cf. <i>Manil.</i>,

  n. 2), and this also is in conformity with the oldest Oriental
  traditions. The rites first used to assure immortality to kings and to
  make them the equals of the gods were extended little by little as a kind
  of privilege, to the important <!-- Page 255 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page255"></a>[255]</span>persons of the state, and only very much
  later were they applied to all who died.</p>

  <p>Regarding the diffusion of this belief from the beginning of the first
  century of our era, see Diels, <i>Elementum</i>, 1899, p. 73, cf. 78;
  Badstübner, <i>Beiträge zur Erklärung Senecas</i>, Hamburg, pp. 2
  ff.&mdash;It is expressed in many inscriptions (Friedländer,
  <i>Sitteng.</i>, III, pp. 749 ff.; Rohde, <i>Psyche</i>, p. 673, cf. 610;
  epitaph of Vezir-Keupru, <i>Studia Pontica</i>, No. 85; <i>CIL</i>. III
  (Salone), 6384; <i>supra</i>, n. <a href="#Nt5_63">63</a>, etc.) It
  gained access into Judaism and paganism simultaneously (cf. Bousset,
  <i>Die Religion des Judentums im neutest. Zeitalter</i>, 1903, p. 271,
  and, for Philo of Alexandria, Zeller, <i>Philos. der Griechen</i>, V, p.
  397 and p. 297).&mdash;During the third century it was expounded by
  Cornelius Labeo, the source of Arnobius and Servius (Nieggetiet, <i>De
  Cornelio Labeone</i> [Diss. Munster], 1908, pp. 77-86). It was generally
  accepted towards the end of the empire; see <i>infra</i>, n. <a
  href="#Nt5_25">25</a>.&mdash;I hope soon to have the opportunity of
  setting forth the development of this sidereal eschatology with greater
  precision in my lectures on "Astrology and Religion in Antiquity" which
  will appear in 1912 (chap. VI).</p>

  <p><a name="Nt5_65" href="#NtA5_65">65</a>. According to the doctrine of
  the Egyptian mysteries the Elysian Fields were in the under-world (Apul.,
  <i>Metam.</i>, XI, 6).&mdash;According to the astrological theory, the
  Elysian Fields were in the sphere of the fixed stars (Macrobius, <i>Comm.
  somn. Scip.</i>, I, 11, §&nbsp;8; cf. <i>infra</i>, chap. VIII, n. <a
  href="#Nt8_25">25</a>). Others placed them in the moon (Servius, <i>Ad
  Aen.</i>, VI, 887; cf. Norden, <i>Vergils Buch</i>, VI, p. 23; Rohde,
  <i>Psyche</i>, pp. 609 ff.). Iamblichus placed them between the moon and
  the sun (Lydus, <i>De mens.</i>, IV, 149, p. 167, 23, Wünsch).</p>

  <p><a name="Nt5_66" href="#NtA5_66">66</a>. The relation between the two
  ideas is apparent in the alleged account of the Pythagorean doctrine
  which Diogenes Laertius took from Alexander Polyhistor, and which is in
  reality an apocryphal composition of the first century of our era. It was
  said that Hermes guided the pure souls, after their separation from the
  body, <span title="eis ton Hupsiston" class="grk"

  §&nbsp;31; cf. Zeller, <i>Philos. der Griechen</i>, V, p. 106, n. 2).&mdash;On
  the meaning of Hypsistos, cf. <i>supra</i>, p. <a
  href="#page128">128</a>. It appears very plainly in the passage of
  Isaiah, xiv, 13, as rendered by the Septuagint: <!-- Page 256 --><span

  <p><a name="Nt5_67" href="#NtA5_67">67</a>. Originally he was the
  thunder-god, in Greek <span title="Keraunos" class="grk"
  >&Kappa;&epsilon;&rho;&alpha;&upsilon;&nu;&#x1F79;&sigmaf;</span>. Under
  this name he appeared for instance on the bas-relief preserved in the
  museum of Brussels (Dussaud, <i>Notes</i>, p. 105). Later, by a familiar
  process, the influence of a particular god becomes the attribute of a
  greater divinity, and we speak of a <span title="Zeus Keraunios" class="grk"
  >&Zeta;&epsilon;&#x1F7A;&sigmaf;
  &Kappa;&epsilon;&rho;&alpha;&#x1F7B;&nu;&iota;&omicron;&sigmaf;</span>
  (cf. Usener, <i>Keraunos</i>, Rhein. Museum, N. F., LX, 1901).&mdash;This
  Zeus Keraunios appears in many inscriptions of Syria (<i>CIG</i>, 4501,
  4520; Le Bas-Waddington, 2195, 2557&nbsp;<i>a</i>, 2631, 2739; cf. Roscher,
  <i>Lexikon Myth.</i>, s.&nbsp;v. "Keraunos").</p>

  <p>He is the god to whom Seleucus sacrificed when founding Seleucia
  (Malalas, p. 199), and a dedication to the same god has been found
  recently in the temple of the Syrian divinities at Rome (<i>supra</i>, n.
  <a href="#Nt5_10">10</a>).&mdash;An equivalent of the Zeus Keraunios is
  the Zeus <span title="Kataibatês" class="grk"
  >&Kappa;&alpha;&tau;&alpha;&iota;&beta;&#x1F71;&tau;&eta;&sigmaf;</span>&mdash;"he
  who descends in the lightning"&mdash;worshiped at Cyrrhus (Wroth,
  <i>Greek Coins in the British Museum</i>: "Galatia, Syria," p. 52 and
  LII; Roscher, <i>Lexikon</i>, s.&nbsp;v.)</p>

  <p><a name="Nt5_68" href="#NtA5_68">68</a>. For instance the double ax
  was carried by Jupiter Dolichenus (cf. <i>supra</i>, p. <a
  href="#page147">147</a>). On its significance, cf. Usener, <i>loc.
  cit.</i>, p. 20.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt5_69" href="#NtA5_69">69</a>. Cf. Lidzbarski, <i>Balsamem,
  Ephem. semit. Epigr.</i>, I, p. 251.&mdash;Ba&lsquo;al Samaïn is
  mentioned as early as the ninth century B.&nbsp;C. in the inscription of Ben
  Hadad (Pognon, <i>Inscr. sémit.</i>, 1907, pp. 165 ff.; cf. Dussaud,
  <i>Rev. archéol.</i>, 1908, I, p. 235). In Aramaic papyri preserved at
  Berlin, the Jews of Elephantine call Jehovah "the god of heaven" in an
  address to a Persian governor, and the same name was used in the alleged
  edicts of Cyrus and his successors, which were inserted in the book of
  Esdras (i. 1; vi. 9, etc.)&mdash;If there were the slightest doubt as to
  the identity of the god of thunder with Baalsamin, it would be dispelled
  by the inscription of Et-Tayibé, where this Semitic name is translated
  into Greek as <span title="Zeus megistos keraunios" class="grk"

  etc.), are also the attributes which, according to the doctrine of
  Alexandrian Judaism, characterized Jehovah (see <i>supra</i>, n. <a
  href="#Nt5_66">66</a>). If he was originally a god of thunder, as has
  been maintained, the evolution of the Jewish theology was parallel to
  that of the pagan conceptions (see <i>supra</i>, n. <a

  1888, I, pp. 184 ff.; Pauly-Wissowa, s.&nbsp;v. "Aeternus," and <i>Festschrift
  für Otto Benndorf</i>, 1898, p. 291.&mdash;The idea of the eternity of
  the gods also appeared very early in Egypt, but it does not seem that the
  mysteries of Isis&mdash;in which the death of Osiris was
  commemorated&mdash;made it prominent, and it certainly was spread in the
  Occident only by the sidereal cults.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt5_80" href="#NtA5_80">80</a>. The question has been raised
  whether the epithet <span lang="he" title="MR' `LM'" ><bdo
  dir="rtl">&#x5DE;&#x5E8;&#x5D0; &#x5E2;&#x5DC;&#x5DE;&#x5D0;</bdo></span>
  means "lord of the world" or "lord of eternity" (cf. Lidzbarski,
  <i>Ephemeris</i>, I, 258; II, 297; Lagrange, p. 508), but in our opinion
  the controversy is to no purpose, since in the spirit of the Syrian
  priests the two ideas are inseparable and one expression in itself
  embraces both, the world being conceived as eternal (<i>supra</i>, n. <a
  href="#Nt5_76">76</a>). See for Egypt, Horapoll., <i>Hieroglyph.</i>, I
  (serpent as symbol of the <span title="aiôn" class="grk"

  the title "lord of the universe" was given to Shamash and Hadad; see
  Jastrow, <i>Religion Babyloniens</i>, I, p. 254, n. 10. Nöldeke has been
  good enough to write me as follows on this subject: "Daran kan kein
  Zweifel sein, dass <span lang="he" title="`LM" ><bdo
  dir="rtl">&#x5E2;&#x5DC;&#x5DD;</bdo></span> zunächst (lange Zeit)
  Ewigkeit heisst, und dass die Bedeutung 'Welt' secundär ist. Ich halte es
  daher für so gut wie gewiss dass das palmyrenische <span lang="he"
  title="MR' `LM'" ><bdo dir="rtl">&#x5DE;&#x5E8;&#x5D0;
  &#x5E2;&#x5DC;&#x5DE;&#x5D0;</bdo></span>, wenn es ein alter Name ist,
  den 'ewigen' Herrn bedeutet, wie ohne Zweifel <span lang="he" title="'L `WLM"
  ><bdo dir="rtl">&#x5D0;&#x5DC; &#x5E2;&#x5D5;&#x5DC;&#x5DD;</bdo></span>,
  Gen., xxi. 33. Das biblische Hebräisch kennt die Bedeutung 'Welt' noch
  nicht, abgesehen wohl von der späten Stelle, Eccl. iii. 11. Und, so viel
  ich sehe, ist im Palmyrenischen sonst <span lang="he" title="`LM'" ><bdo
  dir="rtl">&#x5E2;&#x5DC;&#x5DE;&#x5D0;</bdo></span> immer 'Ewigkeit,'
  z.B. in der häufigen Redensart <span lang="he" title="LBRYK SHMCH L`LM'"

  vorkommende palmyr. <span lang="he" title="MR' KL" ><bdo
  dir="rtl">&#x5DE;&#x5E8;&#x5D0; &#x5DB;&#x5DC;</bdo></span> führt
  allerdings darauf, dass die palmyrenische Inschrift auch in <span

  &#x5E2;&#x5DC;&#x5DE;&#x5D0;</bdo></span> den 'Herrn der Welt' sah. Ja
  der syrische Uebersetzer sieht auch in jenem hebräischen <span lang="he"
  title="'L `WLM" ><bdo dir="rtl">&#x5D0;&#x5DC;
  &#x5E2;&#x5D5;&#x5DC;&#x5DD;</bdo></span> 'den Gott der Welt.' Das
  Syrische hat nämlich einen formalen Unterschied festgestellt zwischen
  <i>&lsquo;&#x101;l&#x103;m</i>, dem Status absolutus, 'Ewigkeit,' und
  <i>&lsquo;&#x101;lm&#x101;</i> [<i>&#x101;l<sup>e</sup>m&#x101;</i>] dem
  Status emphaticus 'Welt.'&mdash;Sollte übrigens die <!-- Page 259

  diesem Worte erst durch Einfluss griechischer Speculation zu Teil
  geworden sein? In der Zingirli-Inschrift bedeuted <span lang="he"

  enumerate here, the most important is that of Albrecht Dieterich, <i>Eine
  Mithrasliturgie</i>, 1903. He has endeavored with some ingenuity to show
  that a mystical passage inserted in a magic papyrus preserved at Paris is
  in reality a fragment of a Mithraic liturgy, but here I share the
  skepticism of Reitzenstein (<i>Neue Jahrb. f. das class. Altertum</i>,
  1904, p. 192) and I have given my reasons in <i>Rev. de l'Instr. publ. en
  Belg.</i>, XLVII, 1904, pp. 1 ff. Dieterich answered briefly in <i>Archiv
  f. Religionswis.</i>, VIII, 1905, p. 502, but without convincing me. The
  author of the passage in question may have been more or less accurate in
  giving his god the external appearance of Mithra, but he certainly did
  not know the eschatology of the Persian mysteries. We know, for <!-- Page
  261 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page261"></a>[261]</span>instance,
  through positive testimony that they taught the dogma of the passage of
  the soul through the seven planetary spheres, and that Mithra acted as a
  guide to his votaries in their ascension to the realm of the blessed.
  Neither the former nor the latter doctrine, however, is found in the
  fantastic uranography of the magician. The name of Mithra, as elsewhere
  that of the magi Zoroaster and Hostanes, helped to circulate an Egyptian
  forgery., cf. Wendland, <i>Die hellenistisch-römische Kultur</i>, 1907,
  p. 168, n. 1. See on this controversy Wünsch's notes in the 2d ed. of the
  <i>Mithrasliturgie</i>, 1910, pp. 225 ff.&mdash;A considerable number of
  new monuments have been published of late years (the mithreum of Saalburg
  by Jacobi, etc.). The most important ones are those of the temple of
  Sidon preserved in the collection of Clercq (De Ridder, <i>Marbres de la
  collection de C.</i>, 1906, pp. 52 ff.) and those of Stockstadt published
  by Drexel (<i>Der obergerm. Limes</i>, XXXIII, Heidelberg, 1910). In the

  <p><a name="Nt6_16" href="#NtA6_16">16</a>. In the <i>Studio Pontica</i>,
  p. 368, I have described a grotto located near Trapezus and formerly
  dedicated to Mithra, but now transformed into a church. We know of no
  other Mithreum. A bilingual dedication to Mithra, in Greek and Aramaic,
  is engraved upon a rock in a wild pass near Farasha (Rhodandos) in
  Cappadocia. Recently it has been republished <!-- Page 263 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page263"></a>[263]</span>with excellent notes by
  Henri Grégoire (<i>Comptes Rendus Acad. des Inscr.</i>, 1908, pp. 434
  ff.), but the commentator has mentioned no trace of a temple. The text
  says that a strategus from Ariaramneia <span title="emageuse Mithrêi" class="grk"
  >&#x1F10;&mu;&#x1F71;&gamma;&epsilon;&upsilon;&sigma;&epsilon;
  &Mu;&#x1F77;&theta;&rho;&#x1FC3;</span>. Perhaps these words must be
  translated according to a frequent meaning of the aorist, by "became a
  magus of Mithra" or "began to serve Mithra as a magus." This would lead
  to the conclusion that the inscription was made on the occasion of an
  initiation. The magus dignity was originally hereditary in the sacred
  caste; strangers could acquire it after the cult had assumed the form of
  mysteries. If the interpretation offered by us is correct the Cappadocian
  inscription would furnish interesting evidence of that transformation in
  the Orient. Moreover, we know that Tiridates of Armenia initiated Nero;

  <p><a name="Nt6_28" href="#NtA6_28">28</a>. <i>Mon. myst. Mithra</i>, I,
  p. 333.&mdash;An inscription discovered in a mithreum at Dorstadt
  (Sacidava in Dacia, <i>CIL</i>, III, 7728, cf. 7729), furnishes, if I
  rightly understand, another proof of the relation existing between the
  Semitic cults and that of the Persian gods. It speaks of a "de[orum?]
  sacerdos creatus a Pal[myr]enis, do[mo] Macedonia, et adven[tor] huius
  templi." This rather obscure text becomes clear when compared with Apul.,
  <i>Metam.</i>, XI, 26. After the hero had been initiated into the
  mysteries of Isis in Greece, he was received at Rome in the great temple
  of the Campus Martius, "fani quidem advena, religionis autem indigena."
  It appears also that this Macedonian, who was made a priest of their
  national gods (Bel, Malakbel, etc.) by a colony of Palmyrenians, was
  received in Dacia by the mystics of Mithra as a member of their
  religion.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt6_29" href="#NtA6_29">29</a>. At Venasa in Cappadocia, for
  instance, the people, even during the Christian period, celebrated a
  panegyric on a mountain, where the celestial Zeus, representing Baalsamin
  and Ahura-Mazda, was formerly worshiped (Ramsay, <i>Church in the Roman
  Empire</i>, 1894, pp. 142, 457). The identification of Bel with
  Ahura-Mazda in Cappadocia results from the Aramaic inscription of Jarpuz
  (Clermont-Ganneau, <i>Recueil</i>, III, <!-- Page 265 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page265"></a>[265]</span>p. 59; Lidzbarski,
  <i>Ephemeris für semit. Epigraphik</i>, I, pp. 59 ff.). The Zeus Stratios
  worshiped upon a high summit near Amasia was in reality Ahura-Mazda, who
  in turn probably supplanted some local god (<i>Studia Pontica</i>, pp.
  173 ff.).&mdash;Similarly the equation Anahita = Ishtar = Ma or Cybele
  for the great female divinity is accepted everywhere (<i>Mon. myst.
  Mithra</i>, I, p. 333), and Ma takes the epithet <span title="anikêtos" class="grk"
  >&#x1F00;&nu;&#x1F77;&kappa;&eta;&tau;&omicron;&sigmaf;</span> like
  Mithra (<i>Athen. Mitt.</i>, XVIII, 1893, p. 415, and XXIX, 1904, p.
  169). A temple of this goddess was called <span title="hieron Astartês" class="grk"
  >&#x1F31;&epsilon;&rho;&#x1F78;&nu;
  &#x1F08;&sigma;&tau;&#x1F71;&rho;&tau;&eta;&sigmaf;</span> in a decree of
  Anisa (Michel, <i>Recueil</i>, No. 536, l. 32).</p>

  <p><a name="Nt6_30" href="#NtA6_30">30</a>. The Mithra "mysteries" are
  not of Hellenic origin (<i>Mon. myst. Mithra</i>, I, p. 239), but their
  resemblance to those of Greece, which Gruppe insists upon (<i>Griech.
  Mythologie</i>, pp. 1596 ff.) was such that the two were bound to become
  confused in the Alexandrian period.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt6_31" href="#NtA6_31">31</a>. Harnack (<i>Ausbreitung des
  Christentums</i>, II, p. 271) sees in this exclusion of the Hellenic
  world a prime cause of the weakness of the Mithra worship in its struggle
  against Christianity. The mysteries of Mithra met the Greek culture with
  the culture of Persia, superior in some respects. But if it was capable
  of attracting the Roman mind by its moral qualities, it was too Asiatic,
  on the whole, to be accepted without repugnance by the Occidentals. The
  same was true of Manicheism.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt6_34" href="#NtA6_34">34</a>. As Plato grew older he
  believed that he could not explain the evils of this world without
  admitting the existence of an "evil soul of the world" (Zeller,
  <i>Philos. der Griechen</i>, II, p. 973, p. 981, n. 1). But this late
  conception, opposed as it is to his entire system, is probably due to the
  influence of Oriental dualism. It is found in the Epinomis (Zeller,
  <i>ibid.</i>, p. 1042, n. 4), where the influence of "Chaldean" theories
  is undeniable; cf. Bidez, <i>Revue de Philologie</i>, XXIX, 1905, p.
  319.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt6_36" href="#NtA6_36">36</a>. Arnobius, who was indebted to
  Cornelius Labeo for some exact information on the doctrines of the magi,
  says (IV, 12, p. 150, 12, Reifferscheid): "Magi suis in accitionibus
  memorant antitheos saepius obrepere pro accitis, esse autem hos quosdam
  materiis ex crassioribus spiritus qui deos se fingant, nesciosque
  mendaciis et simulationibus ludant." Lactantius, the pupil of Arnobius,
  used the same word in speaking of Satan that a Mazdean would have used in
  referring to Ahriman (<i>Inst. divin.</i>, II, 9, 13, p. 144, 13,
  Brandt): "Nox quam pravo illi antitheo dicimus attributam"; he is the
  <i>aemulus Dei</i>.&mdash;Heliodorus who has made use in his
  <i>Aethiopica</i> of data taken from the Mazdean beliefs (see
  <i>Monuments relatifs aux mystères de Mithra</i>, volume I, p. 336, n. 2)
  uses the Greek word in the same sense, (IV, 7, p. 105, 27, Bekker ed.):

  Wien</i>, 1905, Beiblatt, p. 6), in a country where the Mithra worship
  had spread considerably seems to me to refer to this. See Minuc. Felix,
  <i>Octav.</i>, 26: "Magorum et eloquio et negotio primus Hostanes
  angelos, id est ministros et nuntios Dei, eius venerationi novit
  assistere." St. Cypr., "Quod idola dii n. s.," c. 6 (p. 24, 2, Hartel):
  "Ostanes et formam Dei veri negat conspici posse et angelos veros sedi
  eius dicit adsistere." Cf. Tertullian, <i>Apol.</i>, XXIII: "Magi
  habentes invitatorum angelorum et daemonum adsistentem sibi potestatem;"
  Arnobius, II, 35 (p. 76, 15, Reifferscheid); Aug., <i>Civ. Dei</i>, X, 9,
  and the texts collected by Wolff, <i>Porphyrii de philos. ex orac.
  haurienda</i>, 1856, pp. 223 ff.; Kroll, <i>De orac. Chaldaïcis</i>,
  1894, pp. 53; Roscher, <i>Die Hebdomadenlehre der griech.
  Philosophen</i>, Leipsic, 1906, p. 145; Abt, <i>Apuleius und die
  Zauberei</i>, Giessen, 1909, p. 256.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt6_39" href="#NtA6_39">39</a>. Porphyry, <i>De Abstin.</i>,
  II, 37-43, expounds a theory about the demons, which, he says, he took
  from "certain Platonists" (<span title="Platônikoi tines" class="grk"
  >&Pi;&lambda;&alpha;&tau;&omega;&nu;&iota;&kappa;&omicron;&#x1F77;
  &tau;&iota;&nu;&epsilon;&sigmaf;</span>, Numenius and Cronius?). That
  these authors, whoever they were, helped themselves freely to the
  doctrines of the magi, seems to appear immediately from the whole of
  Porphyry's exposition (one could almost give an endless commentary on it
  with the help of the Mazdean books) and in particular from the mention
  that is made of a power commanding the spirits of evil (see <i>supra</i>,
  n. <a href="#Nt6_37">37</a>). This conclusion is confirmed by a
  comparison with the passage of Arnobius cited above (n. <a
  href="#Nt6_36">36</a>), who attributes similar theories to the "magi,"
  and with a chapter of the Ps.-Iamblichus (<i>De mysteriis</i>, III, 31)
  which develops analogous beliefs as being those of "Chaldean
  prophets."&mdash;Porphyry also cites a "Chaldean" theologian in
  connection with the influence of the demons, <i>De regressu animae</i>
  (Aug., <i>Civ. Dei</i>, X, 9).</p>

  <p>I conjecture that the source of all this demonology is the book
  attributed to Hostanes which we find mentioned in the second century of
  our era by Minucius Felix, St. Cyprian (<i>supra</i>, n. <a
  href="#Nt6_38">38</a>), etc.; cf. Wolff, op. cit., p. 138; <i>Mon. myst.
  Mithra</i>, I, p. 33. As a matter of fact it would be false logic to try
  to explain the evolution of demonology, which is above everything else
  religious, by the development of the philosophic theories of the Greeks
  (see for instance the communications of Messrs. Stock and Glover:
  <i>Transactions of the Congress of <!-- Page 268 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page268"></a>[268]</span>History of Rel.</i>,
  Oxford, 1908, II, pp. 164 ff.). The influence of the popular Hellenic or
  foreign ideas has always been preponderant here; and the Epinomis, which
  contains one of the oldest accounts of the theory of demons, as proved
  <i>supra</i>, n. <a href="#Nt6_34">34</a>, was influenced by the Semitic
  notions about genii, the ancestors of the <i>djinns</i> and the
  <i>wélys</i> of Islam.</p>

  <p>If, as we believe, the text of Porphyry really sets forth the theology
  of the magi, slightly modified by Platonic ideas based on popular beliefs
  of the Greeks and perhaps of the barbarians, we shall be able to draw
  interesting conclusions in regard to the mysteries of Mithra. For
  instance, one of the principles developed is that the gods must not be
  honored by the sacrifice of animated beings (<span title="empsucha" class="grk"
  >&#x1F14;&mu;&psi;&upsilon;&chi;&alpha;</span>), and that immolation of
  victims should be reserved for the demons. The same idea is found in
  Cornelius Labeo, (Aug., <i>Civ. Dei</i>, VIII, 13; see Arnobius, VII,
  24), and possibly it was the practice of the Mithra cult. Porphyry (II,
  36) speaks in this connection of rites and mysteries, but without
  divulging them, and it is known that in the course of its history
  Mazdaism passed from the bloody to the bloodless sacrifice (<i>Mon. myst.
  Mithra</i>, I, p. 6).</p>

  <p><a name="Nt6_54" href="#NtA6_54">54</a>. We have explained this theory
  above, p. <a href="#page125">125</a>. It was foreign to the religion of
  Zoroaster and was introduced into the mysteries of Mithra with the
  Chaldean astrology. Moreover, ancient mythological ideas were always
  mixed with this learned theology. For instance, it was an old Oriental
  belief that souls, being regarded as material, wore clothing (<i>Mon.
  myst. Mithra</i>, I, p. 15, n. 5; Bousset, <i>Archiv für
  Religionswiss.</i>, IV, 1901, p. 233, n. 2; <i>Rev. hist. des relig.</i>,

  Thomas): "Mundum sensibilem et, quae in eo sunt, omnia a superiore illo
  mundo quasi ex vestimento esse contecta." I have insisted upon the
  persistence of this idea, because it may help us to grasp the
  significance attributed to a detail of the Mithra ritual in connection
  with which Porphyry relates nothing but contradictory interpretations.
  The persons initiated into the seven degrees were obliged to put on
  different costumes. The seven degrees of initiation successively
  conferred upon the mystic were symbols of the seven planetary spheres,
  through which the soul ascended after death (<i>Mon. myst. Mithra</i>, I,
  p. 316), the garments assumed by the initiates were probably considered
  as emblems of those "tunics" which the soul put on when descending into
  the lower realms and discarded on returning to heaven.</p>

  <i>ibid.</i>, pp. 92 ff. There is no doubt that the veneration of time
  and its subdivisions (seasons, months, days, etc.) spread through the
  influence of astrology. Zeno had deified them; see Cicero, <i>Nat.
  D.</i>, II, 63 (= von Arnim, fr. 165): "Astris hod idem (i.&nbsp;e. vim
  divinam) tribuit, tum annis, mensibus, annorumque mutationibus." In
  conformity with the materialism of the Stoics these subdivisions of time
  were conceived by him as bodies (von Arnim, <i>loc. cit.</i>, II, fr.
  665; cf. Zeller, <i>Ph. Gr.</i>, IV, p. 316, p. 221). The later texts
  have been collected by Drexler in Roscher, <i>Lexikon</i>, s.&nbsp;v. "Mên,"
  II, col. 2689. See also Ambrosiaster, <i>Comm. in epist. Galat.</i>, IV,
  10 (Migne, col. 381 B). Egypt had worshiped the hours, the months, and
  the propitious and adverse years as gods long before the Occident; see

  <p><a name="Nt7_41" href="#NtA7_41">41</a>. When Goethe had made the
  ascent of the Brocken, in 1784, during splendid weather, he expressed his
  admiration by writing the following verses from memory, (II, 115): "Quis
  caelum possit, nisi caeli munere, nosse | Et reperire deum, nisi qui pars
  ipse deorum est?"; cf. <i>Brief an Frau von Stein</i>, No. 518, (Schöll)
  1885, quoted by Ellis in <i>Noctes Manilianae</i>, p. viii.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt7_42" href="#NtA7_42">42</a>. This idea in the verse of
  Manilius (n. 41, cf. IV, 910), and which may be found earlier in
  <i>Somnium Scipionis</i> (III, 4; see Macrobius, <i>Comment.</i> I, 14,
  §&nbsp;16; "Animi societatem cum caelo et sideribus habere communem";
  Pseudo-Apul., <i>Asclepius</i>, c. 6, c. 9. Firmicus Maternus,
  <i>Astrol.</i>, I, 5, §&nbsp;10). dates back to Posidonius who made the
  contemplation of the sky one of the sources of the belief in God
  (Capelle, <i>Jahrb.</i> <!-- Page 275 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page275"></a>[275]</span><i>für das klass. Altertum</i>, VIII,
  1905, p. 534, n. 4), and it is even older than that, for Hipparchus had
  already admitted a "cognationem cum homine siderum, animasque, nostras
  partem esse caeli" (Pliny, <i>Hist. nat.</i>, II, 26, §&nbsp;95).</p>

  the credit of having shown the strength of this astrological fatalism
  (see <i>infra</i>, n. <a href="#Nt7_57">57</a>), believes that it
  developed in Egypt, but surely he is wrong. In this connection see the

  been published by Usener, <i>Rheinisches Mus.</i>, LV, 1900, p.

  Fato (Bardenhewer, <i>Gesch. altchr. Lit.</i>, I, p. 315) has been
  attributed to Minucius Felix; Nicetas of Remesiana (about 400) wrote a
  book <i>Adversus genethlialogiam</i> (Gennadius, <i>Vir. inl.</i>, c.
  22), but the principal adversary of the <i>mathematici</i> was St.
  Augustine (<i>Civ. Dei</i>, c. 1 ff.; <i>Epist.</i>, 246, ad Lampadium,
  etc.). See also Wendland, <i>Die hellenistisch-römische Kultur</i>, p.

  the doctrine of the influence of the stars over human affairs.&mdash;The
  church succeeded in extirpating the learned astrology of the Latin world
  almost completely at the beginning of the Middle Ages. We do not know of
  one astrological treatise, or of one manuscript of the Carlovingian
  period, but the ancient faith in the power of the stars continued in
  secret and gained new strength when Europe came in contact with Arabian
  science.</p>

  <i>Dict. des antiquités</i> of Daremberg, Saglio, Pottier. It contains an

  Apuleius und die Zauberei</i>, Giessen, 1908.&mdash;The superstition that
  is not magic, but borders upon it, is the subject of a very important

  The Assyrio-Chaldean magic may be compared profitably with Hindu magic
  (Victor Henry, <i>La Magie dans l'Inde antique</i>, Paris, 1904).</p>

  <p><a name="Nt7_66" href="#NtA7_66">66</a>. There are many indications
  that the Chaldean magic spread over the Roman empire, probably as a
  consequence of the conquests of Trajan and Verus (Apul., <i>De Magia</i>,
  c. 38; Lucian, <i>Philopseudes</i>, c. 11; <i>Necyom.</i>, c. 6, etc. Cf.
  Hubert, loc. cit.) Those most influential in reviving these studies seem
  to have been two rather enigmatical personages, Julian the Chaldean, and
  his son Julian the Theurge, who lived under Marcus Aurelius. The latter
  was Considered the author of the <span title="Logia Chalda'ika" class="grk"
  >&Lambda;&#x1F79;&gamma;&iota;&alpha;
  &Chi;&alpha;&lambda;&delta;&alpha;&#x3CA;&kappa;&#x1F71;</span>, which in
  a measure became the Bible of the last neo-Platonists.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt7_67" href="#NtA7_67">67</a>. Apul., <i>De Magia</i>, c.
  27. The name <span title="philosophos" class="grk"
  >&phi;&iota;&lambda;&#x1F79;&sigma;&omicron;&phi;&omicron;&sigmaf;</span>,
  <i>philosophus</i>, was finally applied to all adepts in the occult
  sciences.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt7_68" href="#NtA7_68">68</a>. The term seems to have been
  first used by Julian, called the Theurge, and thence to have passed to
  Porphyry (<i>Epist. Aneb.</i>, c. 46; Augustine, <i>Civ. Dei</i>, X,
  9-10) and to the neo-Platonists.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt7_69" href="#NtA7_69">69</a>. Hubert, article cited, pp.
  1494, n. 1; 1499 f.; 1504. Ever since magical papyri were discovered in
  Egypt, there has been a tendency to exaggerate the influence exercised by
  that country on the development of magic. It made magic prominent as we
  have said, but a study of these same papyri proves that elements of very
  different origin had combined with the native sorcery, which seems to
  have laid special stress upon the importance of the "barbarian names,"
  because to the Egyptians the name had a reality quite independent of the
  object denoted by it, and possessed an effective force of its own
  (<i>supra</i>, pp. <a href="#page93">93</a>, <a href="#page95">95</a>).
  But that is, after all, only an incidental theory, and it is significant
  that in speaking of the origin of magic, Pliny (XXX, 7) names the
  Persians in the first place, and does not even mention the Egyptians.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt7_70" href="#NtA7_70">70</a>. <i>Mon. myst. Mithra</i>, I,
  pp. 230 ff.&mdash;Consequently Zoroaster, the undisputed master of the
  magi, is frequently considered a disciple of the Chaldeans or as himself
  coming from Babylon. The blending of Persian and Chaldean beliefs appears
  clearly in Lucian, <i>Necyom.</i>, 6 ff. <!-- Page 280 --><span

  <p><a name="Nt7_71" href="#NtA7_71">71</a>. The majority of the magical
  formulas attributed to Democritus are the work of forgers like Bolos of
  Mendes (cf. Diels, <i>Fragmente der Vorsokratiker</i>, I<sup>2</sup>, pp.
  440 f.), but the authorship of this literature could not have been
  attributed to him, had not these tendencies been so favorable.</p>

  that the demons subsisted on the offerings and particularly on the smoke
  of the sacrifices agrees entirely with the old Persian and Babylonian
  ideas. See Yasht V, XXI, 94: What "becomes of the libations which the
  wicked bring to you after sunset?" "The devas receive them,"

<p class="cenhead">VIII. THE TRANSFORMATION OF PAGANISM.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Bibliography:</span> The history of the destruction
  of paganism is a subject that has tempted many historians. Beugnot
  (1835), Lasaulx (1854), Schulze (Jena, 1887-1892) have tried it with
  varying success (see Wissowa, <i>Religion der Römer</i>, pp. 84 ff.). But
  hardly any one has been interested in the reconstruction of the theology
  of the last pagans, although material is not lacking. The meritorious
  studies of Gaston Boissier (<i>La fin du Paganisme</i>, Paris, 1891)
  treat especially the literary and moral aspects of that great
  transformation. Allard (<i>Julien l'Apostat</i>, I, 1900, p. 39 ff.) has
  furnished a summary of the religious evolution during the fourth
  century.</p>

  (<i>supra</i>, ch. VII, n. <a href="#Nt7_9">9</a>), where the ancient
  devotions maintained themselves; see the <i>Vita S. Eligii</i>, Migne,

  Ambrosiaster, <i>loc. cit.</i>; Maximus of Turin, <i>loc. cit.</i>;
  Lactantius, II, 13, 2: "Elementa mundi, caelum, solem, terram,

  <p><a name="Nt8_17" href="#NtA8_17">17</a>. Cf. <i>Rev. hist. litt.
  rel.</i>, VIII, 1903, pp. 429 ff.&mdash;Until the end of the fifth
  century higher education in the Orient remained in the hands of the
  pagans. The life of Severus of Antioch, by Zachariah the Scholastic,
  preserved in a Syrian translation [<i>supra</i>, ch. VII, n. <a
  href="#Nt7_81">81</a>], is particularly instructive in this regard. The
  Christians, who were opposed to paganism and astrology, consequently
  manifested an aversion to the profane sciences in general, and in that
  way they became responsible to a serious extent for the gradual
  extinction of the knowledge of the past (cf. <i>Rev. hist. litt.
  rel.</i>, <i>ibid.</i>, p. 431; Royer, <i>L'enseignement d'Ausone à
  Alcuin</i>, 1906, p. 130 ff.). But it must be said in their behalf that
  before them Greek philosophy had taught the vanity of every science that
  did not have the moral culture of the ego for its purpose, see Geffcken,
  <i>Aus der Werdezeit des Christentums</i>, p. 7, p. 111.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt8_18" href="#NtA8_18">18</a>. <i>Mon. myst. Mithra</i>, I,

  <p><a name="Nt8_19" href="#NtA8_19">19</a>. Ambrosiaster, <i>Comm. in
  Epist. Pauli</i>, p. 58 B: "Dicentes per istos posse ire ad Deum sicut
  per comites pervenire ad regem" (cf. <i>Rev. his. lit. rel.</i>, VIII,
  1903, p. 427).&mdash;The same idea was set forth by Maximus of Turin
  (<i>Adv. pag.</i>, col. 791) and by Lactantius (<i>Inst. div.</i>, II,
  16, §&nbsp;5 ff., p. 168 Brandt); on the celestial court, see also Arnobius,
  II, 36; Tertullian, <i>Apol.</i>, 24.&mdash;Zeus bore the name of king,
  but the Hellenic Olympus was in reality a turbulent republic. The
  conception of a supreme god, the sovereign of a hierarchical court, seems
  to have been of Persian origin, and to have been propagated by the magi
  and the mysteries of Mithra. The inscription of the Nemroud Dagh speaks
  of <span title="Dios Ôromasdou thronous" class="grk"
  >&Delta;&iota;&#x1F78;&sigmaf;
  &#x1F68;&rho;&omicron;&mu;&#x1F71;&sigma;&delta;&omicron;&upsilon;
  &theta;&rho;&#x1F79;&nu;&omicron;&upsilon;&sigmaf;</span> (<i>supra</i>,
  ch. VI, n. <a href="#Nt6_26">26</a>), and, in fact, a bas-relief shows
  Zeus-Oramasdes sitting on a throne, scepter in hand. The Mithra
  bas-reliefs likewise represent Jupiter Ormuzd on a throne, with the other
  gods standing around him (<i>Mon. myst. Mithra</i>, I, p. 129; II, p.
  188, fig. 11); and Hostanes pictured the angels sitting around the throne
  of God (<i>supra</i>, ch. VI, n. <a href="#Nt6_38">38</a>; see Rev. iv).
  Moreover, the celestial god was frequently compared, not to a king in
  general, but to the Great King, and people spoke of his satraps; cf.
  Pseudo-Arist., <span title="Peri kosmou" class="grk"
  >&Pi;&epsilon;&rho;&#x1F76;
  &kappa;&#x1F79;&sigma;&mu;&omicron;&upsilon;</span>, c. 6, p.
  398&nbsp;<i>a</i>, 10 ff. = Apul., <i>De mundo</i>, c. 26; Philo, <i>De opif.
  mundi</i>, c. 23, 27 (p. 24, 17; 32, 24, Cohn); Maximus of Turin, X, 9;
  and Capelle, <i>Die Schrift von der Welt</i> (<i>Neue Jahrb. für das
  klass. Altert.</i>, VIII), 1905, p. 556, n. 6. Particularly important is
  a passage of Celsus (Origen, <i>Contra Cels.</i>, VIII, 35) where the
  relation of this doctrine to the Persian demonology is shown. But the
  Mazdean conception must have combined, at an early date, with the old
  Semitic idea that Baal was the lord and master of his votaries
  (<i>supra</i>, p. <a href="#page94">94</a> ff.). In his
  <i>Neutestamentliche Zeitgeschichte</i>, (2d. ed., 1906, p. 364 ff.),
  Holtzmann insists on the fact that the people derived their conception of
  the kingdom of God from the pattern of the Persian monarchy. See also
  <i>supra</i>, p. <a href="#page111">111</a>.</p>

  <p>A comparison similar to this one, which is also found among the pagans
  of the fourth century, is the comparison of heaven with a city (Nectarius
  in St. Aug., <i>Epist.</i>, 103 [Migne, <i>P. L.</i>, XXXIII, col. 386]):
  "Civitatem quam magnus Deus et bene meritae de eo animae habitant," etc.
  Compare the City of God of St. Augustine and the celestial Jerusalem of
  the Jews <!-- Page 285 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page285"></a>[285]</span>(Bousset, <i>Religion des Judentums</i>,
  1903, p. 272).&mdash;Cf. also Manilius, V, 735 ff.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt8_20" href="#NtA8_20">20</a>. August., <i>Epist.</i> 16
  [48] (Migne, <i>Pat. Lat.</i>, XXXIII, col. 82): "Equidem unum esse Deum
  summum sine initio, sine prole naturae, seu patrem magnum atque
  magnificum, quis tam demens, tam mente captus neget esse certissimum?
  Huius nos virtutes per mundanum opus diffusas multis vocabulis invocamus,
  quoniam nomen eius cuncti proprium videlicet ignoramus. Nam Deus omnibus
  religionibus commune nomen est. Ita fit ut, dum eius quasi quaedam membra
  carptim variis supplicationibus prosequimur, totum colere profecto
  videamur." And at the end: "Dii te servent, per quos et eorum atque
  cunctorum mortalium communem patrem, universi mortales, quos terra
  sustinet, mille modis concordi discordia, veneramur et colimus." Cf.
  Lactantius Placidus, <i>Comm. in Stat. Theb.</i>, IV, 516.&mdash;Another
  pagan (<i>Epist.</i>, 234 [21], Migne, <i>P. L.</i>, XXXIII, col. 1031)
  speaks "deorum comitatu vallatus, Dei utique potestatibus emeritus, id
  est eius unius et universi et incomprehensibilis et ineffabilis
  infatigabilisque Creatoris impletus virtutibus, quos (<i>read</i> quas)
  ut verum est angelos dicitis vel quid alterum post Deum vel cum Deo aut a
  Deo aut in Deum."</p>

  <p><a name="Nt8_21" href="#NtA8_21">21</a>. The two ideas are contrasted
  in the <i>Paneg. ad Constantin. Aug.</i>, 313 A.&nbsp;D., c. 26 (p. 212,
  Bährens ed.): "Summe rerum sator, cuius tot nomina sunt quot gentium
  linguas esse voluisti (quem enim te ipse dici velis, scire non possumus),
  sive tute quaedam vis mensque divina es, quae toto infusa mundo omnibus
  miscearis elementis et sine ullo extrinsecus accedente vigoris impulsu
  per te ipsa movearis, sive alique supra omne caelum potestas es quae hoc
  opus tuum ex altiore naturae arce despicias."&mdash;Compare with what we
  have said of <i>Jupiter exsuperantissimus</i> (<span class="correction"
  title="text reads `p. 190'">p. <a href="#page128">128</a></span>).</p>

  <p><a name="Nt8_22" href="#NtA8_22">22</a>. Macrobius, <i>Sat.</i>, I, 17
  ff.; cf. Firm. Mat., <i>Err. prof. rel.</i>, c. 8; <i>Mon. myst.
  Mithra</i>, I, 338 ff. Some have supposed that the source of Macrobius's
  exposition was Iamblichus.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt8_23" href="#NtA8_23">23</a>. Julian had intended to make
  all the temples centers of moral instruction (Allard, <i>Julien
  l'Apostat</i>, II, 186 ff.), and this great idea of his reign was
  partially realized after his death. His homilies were little appreciated
  by the bantering <!-- Page 286 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page286"></a>[286]</span>and frivolous Greeks of Antioch or
  Alexandria, but they appealed much more to Roman gravity. At Rome the
  rigorous mysteries of Mithra had paved the way for reform. St. Augustine,
  <i>Epist.</i>, 91 [202] (Migne, <i>P. L.</i>, XXXIII, col. 315), c. 408
  A.&nbsp;D., relates that moral interpretations of the old myths were told
  among the pagans during his time: "Illa omnia quae antiquitus de vita
  deorum moribusque conscripta sunt, longe aliter sunt intelligenda atque
  interpretanda sapientibus. Ita vero in templis populis congregatis
  recitari huiuscemodi salubres interpretationes heri et nudiustertius
  audivimus." See also <i>Civ. Dei</i>, II, 6: "Nec nobis nescio quos
  susurros paucissimorum auribus anhelatos et arcana velut religione
  traditos iactent (pagani), quibus vitae probitas sanctitasque discatur."
  Compare the epitaph of Praetextatus (<i>CIL</i>, VI, 1779 = Dessau,
  <i>Inscr. sel.</i>, 1259): "Paulina veri et castitatis conscia | dicata
  templis," etc.&mdash;Firmicus Maternus (<i>Mathes</i>, II, 30) demands of
  the astrologer the practice of all virtues, "antistes enim deorum
  separatus et alienus esse debet a pravis illecebris voluptatum.... Itaque
  purus, castus esto, etc."</p>

  <p><a name="Nt8_24" href="#NtA8_24">24</a>. This is clearly asserted by
  the verses of the epitaph cited (v. 22 ff): "Tu me, marite, disciplinarum
  bono | puram ac pudicam <span class="scac">SORTE MORTIS EXIMENS</span>, |
  in templa ducis ac famulam divis dicas: | Te teste cunctis imbuor
  mysteriis." Cf. Aug., <i>Epist.</i>, 234 (Migne, <i>P. L.</i>, XXXIII,
  col. 1031, letter of a pagan to the bishop,): "Via est in Deum melior,
  qua vir bonus, piis, puris iustis, castis, veris dictisque factisque
  probatus et deorum comitatu vallatus ... ire festinat; via est, inquam,
  qua purgati antiquorum sacrorum piis praeceptis expiationibusque
  purissimis et abstemiis observationibus decocti anima et corpore
  constantes deproperant."&mdash;St. Augustine (<i>Civ. Dei</i>, VI, 1 and
  VI, 12) opposes the pagans who assert "deos non propter praesentem vitam
  coli sed propter aeternam."</p>

  <p><a name="Nt8_25" href="#NtA8_25">25</a>. The variations of this
  doctrine are set forth in detail by Macrobius, <i>In Somn. Scip.</i>, I,
  11, §&nbsp;5 ff. According to some, the soul lived above the sphere of the
  moon, where the immutable realm of eternity began; according to others,
  in the spheres of the fixed stars where they placed the Elysian Fields
  (<i>supra</i>, ch. V, n. <a href="#Nt5_65">65</a>; see Martian,
  <i>Capella</i>, II, 209). The Milky Way in particular was assigned to
  them as their residence <!-- Page 287 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page287"></a>[287]</span>(Macr., <i>ib.</i>, c. 12; cf. Favon.
  Eulog., <i>Disput. de somn. Scipionis</i>, p. 1, 20 [Holder ed.]: "Bene
  meritis ... lactei circuli lucida ac candens habitatio deberetur"; St.
  Jerome, <i>Ep.</i>, 23, §&nbsp;3 [Migne, <i>P. L.</i>, XXII, col. 426), in
  conformity with an old Pythagorean doctrine (Gundel, <i>De stellarum
  appellatione et relig. Romana</i>, 1907, p. 153 [245]), as well as an
  Egyptian doctrine (Maspero, <i>Hist. des peuples de l'Orient</i>, I, p.
  181).&mdash;According to others, finally, the soul was freed from all
  connection with the body and lived in the highest region of heaven,
  descending first through the gates of Cancer and Capricorn, at the
  intersection of the zodiac and the Milky Way, then through the spheres of
  the planets. This theory, which was that of the mysteries (<i>supra</i>,
  pp. <a href="#page126">126</a>, <a href="#page152">152</a>) obtained the
  approbation of Macrobius ("quorum sectae amicior est ratio") who explains
  it in detail (I, 12, §&nbsp;13 ff.). Arnobius, who got his inspiration from
  Cornelius Labeo (<i>supra</i>, ch. V, n. <a href="#Nt5_64">64</a>),
  opposed it, as a widespread error (II, 16): "Dum ad corpora labimur et
  properamus humana ex mundanis circulis, sequuntur causae quibus mali
  simus et pessimi." Cf. also, II, 33: "Vos, cum primum soluti membrorum
  abieretis e nodis, alas vobis adfuturas putatis quibus ad caelum pergere
  atque ad sidera volare possitis," etc.). It had become so popular that
  the comedy by Querolus, written in Gaul during the first years of the
  fifth century, alluded to it in a mocking way, in connection with the
  planets (V, 38): "Mortales vero addere animas sive inferis nullus labor
  sive superis." It was still taught, at least in part, by the
  Priscillianists (Aug., <i>De haeres.</i>, 70; Priscillianus, éd.
  Schepss., p. 153, 15; cf. Herzog-Hauck, <i>Realencycl.</i>, 3d ed., s.&nbsp;v.
  "Priscillian," p. 63.&mdash;We have mentioned (<i>supra</i>, <span
  class="correction" title="text reads `ch. V'">ch. VI</span>, n. <a
  href="#Nt6_54">54</a>) the origin of the belief and of its diffusion
  under the empire.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt8_27" href="#NtA8_27">27</a>. This idea was spread by the
  Stoics (<span title="ekpurôsis" class="grk"
  >&#x1F10;&kappa;&pi;&#x1F7B;&rho;&omega;&sigma;&iota;&sigmaf;</span>) and
  by astrology (<i>supra</i>, <span class="correction" title="text reads `p. 262'"

  <p><a name="Nt8_28" href="#NtA8_28">28</a>. Gruppe (<i>Griech.

  that entered into this doctrine.</p>

  href="#page134">134</a> f., p. <a href="#page160">160</a> and
  <i>passim</i>. The similarity <!-- Page 288 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page288"></a>[288]</span>of the pagan theology to Christianity was
  strongly brought out by Arnobius, II, 13-14.&mdash;Likewise in regard to
  the Orient, de Wilamowitz has recently pointed out the close affinity
  uniting the theology of Synesius with that of Proclus (<i>Sitzungsb.
  Akad. Berlin</i>, XIV, 1907, pp. 280 ff.) he has also indicated how
  philosophy then led to Christianity.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt8_30" href="#NtA8_30">30</a>. M. Pichon (<i>Les derniers
  écrivains profanes</i>, Paris, 1906) has recently shown how the eloquence
  of the panegyrists unconsciously changed from paganism to monotheism. See
  also Maurice, <i>Comptes Rendus Acad. Inscriptions</i>, 1909, p.
  165.&mdash;The vague deism of Constantine strove to reconcile the
  opposition of heliolatry and Christianity (Burckhardt, <i>Die Zeit
  Constantins</i>, pp. 353 ff.) and the emperor's letters addressed to
  Arius and the community of Nicomedia (Migne, <i>P. G.</i>, LXXXV, col.
  1343 ff.) are, as shown by Loeschke (<i>Das Syntagma des Gelasius</i>
  [Rhein. Mus., LXI], 1906, p. 44), "ein merkwürdiges Produkt theologischen
  Dilettantismus, aufgebaut auf im wesentlichen pantheistischer Grundlage
  mit Hilfe weniger christlicher Termini und fast noch weniger christlicher
  Gedanken." I shall cite a passage in which the influence of the
  astrological religion is particularly noticeable (col. 1552 D): <span
